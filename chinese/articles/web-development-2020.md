![2020年的Web开发：您应该学习哪些知识](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2019/12/desktop-cropped.jpg)

今天，我最喜欢的一位老师 Brad Traversy 发表了他向您推荐的 2020 年学习如何成为 Web 开发者的概述。

Brad 略去了您在社交媒体上听到的许多炒作。他的建议是切实可行的。我赞同他所建议学习的几乎所有知识。

为了方便起见，我在下面总结了他的一些主要见解。同时，我建议您观看他的完整视频，该视频已嵌入到下面。除了这些总结所传达的内容之外，他还在视频中详述了许多细节方法。这是一个时长 73 分钟的视频。

我还建议您订阅他的 Traversy Media YouTube 频道。在过去的十年中，Brad 一直是一位非常出色的老师，他发表了近 800 部有关技术的视频。

Brad 的订阅者数量已经快达到一百万。让我们看看是否可以帮助他在新的一年里达到一百万。[你可以在这里订阅][1].

# 2020 年的 Web 开发：概述

该视频的主要目的是使您熟悉一些可供 Web 开发者使用的更主流的 Web 开发工具。

“我并不想用海量技术淹没你。这些只是您拥有的选择……目前存在很多技术。当您听到类似 Nuxt 或 Gatsby 的声音时，我想让您知道它是什么。然后您可以选择是否要学习。”

Brad 首先鼓励人们先问他们想做什么。您想在一家产品公司工作吗？还是担任顾问？你想做自由职业吗？还是建立自己的产品？

他关于学习什么的很多建议都归结为您的目标。因此，他提出了许多工具建议。

首先，他建议学习所谓的“必需品”。

该幻灯片和所有后续幻灯片均来自 Brad 的视频。下划线表示他个人推荐的工具。

他指出了一件反直觉的事：您不需要花哨的计算机来进行 Web 开发。“这不像游戏引擎开发之类的东西，因此您可以使用中型笔记本电脑或台式机，甚至还可以使用低端计算机。”

他将 MacOS，Windows 10 和 Linux 用于云服务器，甚至用于某些媒体服务器。

他非常喜欢 VS Code 的编辑器，并使用 Chrome 及其内置的 DevTools 进行基于浏览器的调试。这就是说，他认为 Firefox 也已经走了很长一段路，并且是可行的替代方案。

他建议从标准 HTML 和 CSS 开始，并学习更新的 CSS 工具，例如 Flexbox 和 Grid。

他认为在 2020 年学习响应式网页设计是理所当然的。“你创建的每一个正式项目都应该看起来协调，并且在所有设备上都可以完全使用。”

他建议您练习构建自己的模块化 CSS 组件，以便在整个项目中重用，而不是依赖于 Bootstrap 之类的 CSS 框架。

话虽如此，他说您在为不同雇主从事项目时可能会遇到选择 CSS 框架的问题。

Bootstrap is still by far the most popular CSS framework, but there are a few other widely-used ones, too.

He specifically mentions Tailwind, which I hadn't heard of before. Tailwind is a bit different from other CSS frameworks. It's focused on "utility classes" that you can combine to accomplish what you want with the design.

It's no surprise that Brad recommends getting really good with JavaScript.

Some of the fundamentals you should get good with. Brad has videos for most of these topics, and most of this is covered in the freeCodeCamp curriculum as well.

## Learning at a Practical Pace

Throughout Brad's guide, he repeatedly emphasizes the need for practicality.

Yes - there are best practices for everything. But in many cases, there is a good enough way that will help you move faster and get more done, without getting mired in tools.

One of the most interesting (and perhaps heretical) things he says:

"There's no need to learn DevOps and AWS and all these things for a small site. A hosting site or a managed hosting site like InMotion or Hostgator is fine. It allows you to do \[deployment\] right in the browser. There's no need to overcomplicate things."

He argues that even in 2020, there's something to be said for using familiar tools.

For people new to web development, Brad recommends first getting to the point of being able to work as a basic front end web developer. This will allow you to build websites for local businesses as a freelancer.

"Hipsters will say you definitely need to use a front end framework. I don't think that is true. If you want to render templates on the server without using a front end framework, I think that's absolutely fine, but there are many many jobs that are looking for something like React or Vue."

But once you're ready to tackle front end frameworks, he recommends you explore React, Vue, and Angular. "Try all three and figure out which one you like the best."

He also gives a nod to Svelte - which isn't a framework, but rather a compiler. But he says it's probably too new to try and pick up in 2020.

And he discusses the increasing popularity of Server Side Rendering. File system-based routing means you don't have to create a complicated routing file. Instead, you can just put the files in the directory you want them to be in.

The two popular Server Side Rendering tools are Next.js (for React) and Nuxt.js (the Vue option).

Another emerging trend is Static Site Renders, which he says you don't need to learn but you should be aware of. For example, Gatsby sites are extremely fast and don't need a server.

## Back End Development Tools

A slide from Brad's talk with the most popular frameworks for each language.

For server-side development, Brad prefers Node.js for its speed and because he can use the JavaScript on both front and back end.

For server side development frameworks, he recommends learning Express since it's the most popular and "it gives you a lot of freedom to build things how you want your own way."

He also uses Python for some projects, and recommends it as well.

"Python has two awesome frameworks. Django is a large, full featured framework, where as Flask is more minimalistic. It gives you what you need but you make the rest of the decisions. I honestly can't pick one of the two, I love them both and use them for different things."

And he's quick to come to the defense of PHP:

"A lot of people give crap to PHP and it's unfortunate because PHP can be a great language. It's practical and it's simple to deploy just about anywhere. PHP is great for freelancers that need to get stuff out quickly. If you're planning on working for a large company, PHP may not be the best choice, but if you're freelancing and building personal projects, PHP can be great choice. It's become cool to bash PHP. PHP was the first language I learned and I still really like it... If you look at Laravel code it's very elegant."

Brad also does a quick walkthrough of databases, and recommends perennial favorite PostgreSQL.

## Other Tools That are Probably Here to Stay

GraphQL is an alternative to REST for APIs. There are several courses that cover GraphQL on both Brad's channel and on freeCodeCamp's channel. But he says, "GraphQL is not something that you have to learn these days, but it's big enough that I think it's here to stay. It's more than a trend."

Brad also talks about Content Management Systems (CMS's) and how they are evolving into new "headless" options where you just use them as a back end and code your own front end.

"CMS's are very handy for freelancers who have clients that want to be able to log in and create their blog posts and stuff like that. A lot of people bash WordPress, but there's a huge percentage of websites on the internet that are run by WordPress and it's still very popular."

For webservers he prefers NGINX to Apache because "it seems to be less complicated." We use NGINX extensively at freeCodeCamp and I am inclined to agree.

Brad also explains how virtualization works, and talks about how it can simplify more complex projects by standardizing the environment across multiple computers. But he cautions against trying to virtualize everything:

"Docker is really good for teams. What I don't like is when people say you should always use Docker. It's just preference. If you just want to run a local LAMP server, there's nothing wrong with that. Don't feel pressure to learn something like Docker."

And he adds, to emphasize something I personally cannot emphasize enough: "I know a lot of nerdy types just want to overcomplicate things and I hate that. Just because I'm listing all of this doesn't mean I'm pushing it on you."

He's also quick to point out that most big companies have dedicated DevOps teams (also called "Site Reliability Engineers") who can do a lot of this for you.

## Nice To Have Skills You Can Learn as Specialties

If you want to test your hands at mobile app development, Brad strongly recommends the Flutter framework. It uses Dart, which is a more obscure language. He describes Dart as somewhere between Java and JavaScript, and says if you know either of those languages you should be able to pick it up.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/12/download--9-.png)

His second choice for mobile app development is React Native, which is easy to pick up if you already know React.

Brad then does a great job of explaining what Progressive Web Apps are and some of the benefits of them. Here's the slide, but again, I strongly encourage you to watch his full video.

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2019/12/download--10-.png)

Then he touches on Electron, which allows you to build desktop applications using JavaScript. He was initially skeptical but says some of his favorite desktop apps - like VS Code and Discord - are now built using Electron.

He mentions the JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup) and serverless architecture. These are more advanced topics, but he has some videos on this, too.

And then he gets to the big trends for 2020.

## Machine Learning and Web Assembly

Just because everyone else is talking about machine learning doesn't mean you have to drop everything and learn it. That's how he prefaces this stage of his talk.

And yes, you can do machine learning in JavaScript, too.

"Python is the king for Machine Learning. But even with JavaScript you have TensorFlow.js, you have Brain.js to create neural networks and do some real cool stuff."

It's clear from the way he talks about Web Assembly that he's pretty excited about it.

"Web Assembly is still in its early stages but I think we're going to see more of it this year. Traditionally we use JavaScript on the web page to manipulate the DOM and run calculations. JavaScript has limitations in terms of speed. A language like C or C++ is much faster than JavaScript. So Web Assembly is an efficient, low-level byte code that can be executed by a browser and it's extremely fast. It can be generated by languages like C, C++, and Rust."

Rust is one of the languages you can use with WebAssembly (in addition to C and C++). It's significantly easier to learn and use than C and C++.

But it's important to note that WebAssembly doesn't excuse you from having to learn JavaScript.

"You can almost think of JavaScript as the boss, and it can tell Web Assembly what to do. So it allows us to use really fast low-level languages like C++ in our web apps, and this gives us a lot more capabilities - like next level video games and video editing tools right in the browser - things that are unthinkable with just JavaScript."

In closing he says, "The more you learn, the easier it is to learn more and to fit all of these technologies together. Try not to get overwhelmed. Take it one step at a time and do some research, and figure out what you want to do."

Again, I want to thank Brad Traversy for putting together this comprehensive video.

People ask me all the time "what should I learn if I want to become a web developer?" And my answer is "just use freeCodeCamp as your core curriculum, and branch out into other learning resources as you go."

And I'm happy to say that  [Brad's Traversy Media YouTube channel][2]  is one of those resources I recommend most highly. Brad, if you're reading this, congrats on 10 years of YouTube videos. Here's to 10 more.
