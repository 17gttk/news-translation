如果你正准备为客户建一个自由职业网站，或是打造自己的作品，那么你可能面临这样的难题：
如果你并没有任何网站设计的技巧，如何打造一个网站呢？
有以下方案可以选择：
- 你可以雇一个网站设计师来为你设计-不过设计师或者说好的设计师通常并不便宜。
- 你也可以在Fiverr或者Upwork上找一个便宜的设计师-但是你也知道这是有风险的。
- 或者你可以直接从网上下载一个免费甚至是高级的主题模板-不过通常这不会满足你的所有要求
还有个方法是自己学习设计和布局网站的技巧，然后打造出自己的前端展现效果。
既然你此刻在阅读这篇文章，那就表明你短时间内并不准备成为一名出色的设计师。而对于复杂的网站，你最终也需要一名专业的设计师。
但是我也相信你可以学会如何设计简单的网站，这可以应对大部分小企业的网站需求。
你将可以学到以下两点：
- 了解网站的基础是如何在视觉上呈现出来的
- 从现有的网站设计中找到灵感和想法
这正是我用来建立自己网站的技巧。当然，这只是一个很简单，没有太过精巧的设计。但是通常简单也正是你需要的。
只要你掌握了设计布局网站的基础，就可以建立自己或是给自由职业者客户定制的网站。
当然，你建立的每一个网站都会给你积累经验。随着你不断地练习技能，将会创造出越来越复杂的设计。
以下是一些建立网站的关进步骤：
- 确定网站的基础内容
- 设计网站布局
- 整合设计
- 打造最终产品
每一步都需要大量研究支撑-浏览其他网站看看他们是怎么做的，然后将可以用在你自己网站的部分拆分出来。
要提醒的一点是：我并不是鼓励你去抄袭别人的样式或者图片。（首先你不能通过复制粘贴来获得技能）
我的观点是获得创新概念，再创造出相似的设计。
### 确定网站的基础内容
在你选择颜色或是字体之前，我们先看看以下几个关于网站的常见问题：
1. 这个网站是用来推广哪种商业的？
披萨店？摄影工作室？或是书店？网站推广对于所有的商业都是有用的，因为你可以任意选择。
我们这次将选择一个名叫Central Coffee的虚拟咖啡店。因为人们都爱咖啡，对不对？
2. 这个网站要包含什么样的页面？
通用的页面包括主页、关于我们、联系我们和有关公司产品的介绍。
确定页面构造最好的方法就是先做一个简单的在线调查。
### 调查现有网站
选择3-4个相似行业的网站，观察网站都包含哪些页面。
注意网站是如何设计的并做好笔记：
- 网站包含哪些页面，
- 网站整体样式是怎样的，
- 导航和搜索的便捷性，
- 还有其他你感兴趣的方面
Theme Forest是一个寻找示例网站很好的网站，上面有大量免费和高级的网站模板以及主题。如果你有关注最流行的主题，就会知道他们通常是好设计的典范。
下面是一个我找到的咖啡店示例：

### [The7][3]
![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/CwDQtWgEDoAuCV2QbGOwk4-2haLo6ShbjfZA)
**页面：
单页网站有以下模块：主页、关于我们、地点、赞助商、菜单、新闻、声明、博客
**样式：
现代简洁，高质图片
**导航：
便捷导航

And here are some websites that I found from a “coffee shop in Chicago” search:

### [The Wormhole Coffee][4]

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/KgKQlk0O0aC8CCXbyV8DaLxUBHfDncZ6rO6x)

**Pages:**  
Homepage, Blog, Location/Contact, Job Opportunities

**Style:**  
Sort of modern; photos of the shop are more nostalgic

**Navigation:**  
Not immediately obvious that this is a coffee shop. It’s a bit difficult to navigate the site.

### [Caffe Streets][5]

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/wJ9dMdP7xxHxtoCB2a9EYDTHUsd0WoaokzgI)

**Pages:**  
One page website, the sections are: Home, Caffe (About), Menu, Roasting, Time Machine (juices), Contact Form

**Style:**  
Simple and modern (Squarespace)

**Navigation:**  
Pretty easy to navigate. I like the sticky menu bar up top that scrolls you down to each section.

### [Build Coffee][6]

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/HDMc3Ey2CObm46o17kvJHGWhgKjrxdoRgPn-)

**Pages:**  
One page website, the sections are: Homepage, About, Hours, Location, Shop, Catering, Events, Contact

**Style:**  
Simple, design is a combination of full-width photos between sections of white background with text.

**Navigation:**  
Pretty easy to navigate

### [Sawada Coffee][7]

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/PZRfYxllDpERdb8oB8I3UuG2F-fT2BX73eMZ)

**Pages:**  
Homepage, About, Food & Drink, Press, Contact & Hours, Our Restaurants, Jobs

**Style:**  
Design is mostly about the photography, and the text seems almost an afterthought

**Navigation:**  
It’s a bit difficult to navigate — I almost didn’t see the hamburger menu in the right corner.

### Write down notes for your own website

Now, after looking at multiple coffee shop websites, we have a much better idea of what features are common. And we have some ideas of what we think works and doesn’t work.

Based on your research, you can now start writing down notes for your own site.

For Central Coffee, I think we’re going to stick with a simple one page website, with the following sections:

-   Header
-   Home
-   About
-   Menu
-   Location/Contact
-   Footer

### Plan the layout of your website

Now that we’ve figured out the skeleton of the site, we’ll flesh out each page or section with the elements that we want to put in each one. The layout that we’ll end up making is also called a  **wireframe**.

In the wireframe, we’re not exactly designing anything, meaning no fonts, colors, or photos yet. We’re just figuring out the kind of content that we want, and roughly where it will be on the page. It’s more like a blueprint or a diagram at this point.

### Header

I like the top navigation bar that’s on the Seven Coffee demo page, and the Caffe Streets website.

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/JjSmjbTYDE5Qd9i4cH9W4rpKDxLXk92VTw-s)

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/hszTPLF2H01n7v--G7mXhzQxyUCxK-5ARteB)

However, on both those pages it’s centered, and I’d rather have it aligned to the left, with the logo first and the sections after.

That’s for the desktop version. For tablet and mobile, we’ll just have the logo and hamburger menu in the header by default.

Clicking the hamburger will open up an off canvas menu that will slide in from the right to display the section navigation.

### Home

Since it’s a one page site, the “homepage” will be what you initially see on the screen when you load the website. And I like how Seven Coffee has a little tagline under the name.

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/jlAIYSPgnei-1Wt4Ys51MUIBBGDqu7o1dlsU)

I think here I’ll have an image in the background (like Build Coffee) with the text on top of it. It’ll be the same on both desktop and mobile.

### About

All the websites have a short About section, some with photos. I’ll put in a paragraph about the cafe and also include a few photos of the interior of the shop to entice users to want to come visit.

### Menu

Each of the websites handles menus differently:

-   Seven Coffee has a grid of menu items with prices,
-   Caffe Streets just has a list of items,
-   and Build and Sawada link out to PDFs of the menu.

Personally I hate when I’m browsing a website on my phone and I have to download a PDF. So I’m going to stick to a simplified menu with drink and food items, and include a few photos.

### Location/Contact

I want to put the location, hours, and contact information at the bottom of the website. My guess is that users will start at the top of the site and scroll their way to the bottom.

Putting the call to action at the bottom will answer the question, “what now?” It will help visitors to take action, specifically by getting directions to the cafe and hopefully visiting!

### Footer

The footer will be pretty minimal. It will just be a small bar with copyright information.

### The complete wireframe

Here are complete wireframes of the desktop and the mobile version of the website. I created these using a free online tool called  [Mockflow][8]. They let you create one project for free, and they have paid plans if you want more than one project.

It’s pretty easy to use, and I like the sketchy style option because it’s fun ?

### Decide the basic design specifications

Again, we’re not going to make super detailed and fancy styles. We do need to figure out some of the basics though. Things like:

#### **Color scheme**

The color scheme is simply the different colors you’re using on the website. Think of it like painting and decorating your house. Usually you would want to stick with neutral tones like grays and white, for most of the spaces. And one or two bright accent colors for the important elements that you want to pop out, like links and buttons.

If you need some color inspiration, Canva has some  [sample color palettes][9]  that you can try out.

For the Central Coffee website, I’m going to use the Fall Collection from that Canva link– it’s a warm color palette based around browns.

![](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/RxiZDgixwfbfhNyCxovKQML3ven3LRzYNoSJ)

I’m trying to evoke that nostalgic, cozy feel associated with coffee shops.

#### **Fonts**

Going back through the websites, pretty much all of them use a sans-serif font (letters that don’t have the “serif,” or the end bars on like typewriter text).

I would pick a simple font for the majority of your text, and then you can go slightly more fancy with a heavier weight font for the titles and headlines.

[Google Fonts][10]  is a great place to look for fonts that you can load on your website for free. Just don’t get too many, because every font family, weight, and style will add additional load to the site.

#### **Images/Photography**

Pick a general style or mood that fits the type of business the website is. For a coffee shop, you generally would want to go with inviting pictures with soft light, cozy or nostalgic feel for interior shots, people chatting and relaxing in the coffee shop, and images of food and drink.

For illustrations and logos, there are some free online graphic design tools that come with images you can use on your website. Some examples are:

-   [Canva][11]
-   [Vectr][12]
-   [Snappa][13]

### Build out the website

Now we have wireframes to tell us generally how everything is laid out. And we have our design references, to help guide the front end styles.

Since we don’t have a designer to create detailed PSDs, we will just go ahead and start building the website from the wireframes we just drew up.

Here is how I usually approach building the front end of a website:

1.  Set up the website files
2.  Create and structure the folders and files.
3.  Get the task runner up and running. (I’m using  [Gulp][14]  for this project.)
4.  Create a separate HTML file for each template.

Then go through these steps for each HTML template:

1.  Create the skeleton structure with the basic HTML elements.
2.  Build out the page elements one by one.
3.  For each element, add in the CSS styles, first making sure each section is laid out correctly.
4.  Check how the page looks in the browser as you work, continuing to make corrections.

### Make sure your website is responsive

While you’re building a site, it’s generally a good idea to check that your styles are looking seamless on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

You can easily check desktop styles on your own computer, with different browsers. For mobile, you can use Chrome’s developer tools, which emulates websites on various mobile devices.

Keep in mind that any emulation tool will not be 100% exactly like what the actual phone or tablet will see. So when testing your styles, you’ll eventually want to check it on a real phone when the website is on the internet.

Here are some device emulators that you can use to test website display:

-   [Responsinator.com][15]  (free)
-   [Screenfly][16]  by Quirktools (free)
-   [Browserstack][17]  (paid) — Browserstack allows you to test virtual machines on actual devices.

### The finished product!

Here’s a screenshot of the finished Central Coffee website:

You can check out the real site for yourself  [on my Github.io page][18].

And that’s how I designed and built a website, without having to hire a designer.
