当你想到阿富汗时，你可能会想到持续 17 年、夺取数千人生命的那场战争。

但在混乱中，有着500万人生活的阿富汗首都喀布尔，一代软件工程师正在重新将它定义为全球技术中心。

每周末，几十个进取的开发者都会在喀布尔附近的办公室一起写代码，并向他人分享他们的知识。

## 走进“编程周末” —— 一个改变喀布尔技术面貌的草根组织

超过 3000 位阿富汗的开发者、准开发者都是参与到了编程周末。

编程周末每周都会在喀布尔举办编程活动。

截至目前，他们已举办超过 100 场活动。

编程周末吸纳了 freeCodeCamp 喀布尔学习小组，它现已成为非营利组织。它专注于帮助喀布尔人改善他们的编程技能，并建立他们的专业网络。

他们通过举办免费编程工作坊、提供交流机会、让技术更容易获得来实现这一点。

> “我们有两种类型的活动。我们每周的活动教新人编程，而月度活动邀请在同一水平的软件工程师和其它专业技术人员，以便他们能分享知识，并提供一个交流机会。”

The CodeWeekend community goes to great lengths to be as inclusive as possible.

It has a strictly-enforced code of conduct that would be right at home at a Silicon Valley tech conference.

The code of conduct encourages behaviors like:

Using welcoming and inclusive language
Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
Focusing on what is best for the community
Showing empathy towards other community members

CodeWeekend is broken down into neighborhood-level chapters — each with chapter leaders. These chapter leaders reach out to local companies and organizations to secure sponsors and venues for events.

“We don’t spend a lot on our events. We need a venue and some refreshments, maybe a projector. Whenever we want to have an event, we contact a private sector organization so they can provide us with space and internet. We’re looking forward to always having at least small room where we can have a dedicated venue.” — Mustafa Ehsan, CodeWeekend mentor
Each event is around 3 hours long. First the teachers start by giving a high-level introduction to a topic. Then everybody starts working through freeCodeCamp.org’s curriculum. 3 or 4 mentors will float around helping people when they get stuck or have a question.

“We have people consistently coming each week, with a high level of passion. Whenever we don’t have an event, people call and ask us why not. They really want this.” — Mustafa Ehsan, CodeWeekend mentor
And their volunteer efforts are working. People from the CodeWeekend community are getting jobs as developers.

Many of the jobs that their community members are getting involve building services for the Afghanistan government and local and international startups and companies.

For example, their teams build and maintains web apps for Human Resources departments and other back office functions.

And in the process, they get to work with exciting new tools like Vue.js and Laravel.

The people behind CodeWeekend and freeCodeCamp Kabul

freeCodeCamp Kabul teacher Mustafa Ehsan leads many of the CodeWeekend events.
Jamshid Hashimi is the founder of CodeWeekend. At age 13, he started a football club in the rural village where he grew up.

He went on to study at Dokuz Eylul University in Turkey before working at companies like Rumie and Alidrivers.

CodeWeekend was the perfect intersection of his two passions — technology and community building — so he created the organization in 2014.

Shaheen Naikpay isn’t a developer by profession. He has a background in educational psychology. He works as a project manager on the military side of the industry.

But Shaheen says he likes to contribute to society, and CodeWeekend is a big part of that. He volunteers as CodeWeekend’s event management coordinator.

Some of the events are sponsored by Netlinks, Mustafa’s employer. The CEO of Netlinks actively encourages CodeWeekend to host the event there in the company’s large hall.

Jawed Mansoor completed his computer science degree in India. He works as a database engineer. He helps organize CodeWeekend events in Kabul.

Fazila Nazary is an experienced database developer and instructor. She is the CodeWeekend director for Mazar-i Sharif, another city in Afghanistan.

The organization also has a broad roster of regular event mentors, including Mustafa Ehsan, Jalal Saidi, Sediq Khan, Mohammad Ali Abbasi, and Akmal Arzhang.


If you’re traveling to Kabul, be sure to join the CodeWeekend Facebook group so you can attend one of their events.

And you can also support millions of people around the world who are learning to code. Make a tax-deductible donation to freeCodeCamp.org.

Together, we can create more free education resources. We can support communities like CodeWeekend, and the impact they’re making on the lives of people in their community.
