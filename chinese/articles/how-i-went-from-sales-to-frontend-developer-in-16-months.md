2015年8月18日，我正在多伦多飞往哥本哈根的飞机上，准备开启在哥本哈根商学院为期两学期的交换生活。

那天是我哥哥的生日，所以我对这个日期记得格外清晰。他不得不在机场度过这个生日，因为全家人都在机场为我送行，他们原以为我只是去八个月。

过去我对哥本哈根的唯一了解是从[CPH Open on Thrasher Magazine's YouTube channel][1]这个油管频道得到的。幸运的是我完完全全地爱上了这个城市，于是在第一个学期之后我决定要在哥本哈根待更久时间。我没有选择在加拿大实习，而是尽可能在哥本哈根找一份实习工作。


## 在哥本哈根工作

然而我对此毫无计划，所以我开始找销售发展代表的实习。我之前在某节课上听说过这个初级职位，因为我之前的工作经历都与销售和客服有关，我以为这会非常合适。

我投了简历给一家初创企业，四小时不到，我已经在和我未来的销售经理通电话了。这是我第一次感受到创业公司的快节奏！一个月后我入职了。这也是我第一次接触到专业程序员。

虽然我只在高中的 Visual Basic 课程里接触过软件开发，但是我对技术一直有着很深的兴趣。

这份工作让我第一次有了和程序员共同工作的机会。他们的工作听起来非常酷。他们谈论一些专业术语和技术————React, Ember, Scala, Python, TypeScript, boilerplate-code, compliers, rendering。开发软件竟然需要了解这么多内容，这听起来令人害怕。

办公区的地板

接下来一年半我继续在销售职位上打拼，最终我升职成了客户主管。在这份工作中，我感到我的沟通能力、时间管理能力、表现能力都得到了很大的提升。

## 发现了freeCodeCamp

虽然我作为一名客户主管还算成功，我对自己未来是否愿意在销售业发展还是存在疑问。而且在母语非英语的国家里做英语销售，职业选择也有所限制。

我开始拓展阅读，寻找新爱好或者挑战。我就是在这时发现了 freeCodeCamp 的博客（当时还建在 Medium 上）。我花了几天时间才意识到 freeCodeCamp 并不仅仅是一个博客，它是一个在线免费学习编程的平台！网站名已经不言而喻了...

在做完几道HTML题之后我已经完全着迷了。那时我就决定在空闲时间完成 freeCodeCamp 的课程，为了在遥远将来的某天能成为一名开发人员，和我的同事讨论 React。我喜欢这个想法。

## 艰难地学习基础知识

我很快地学习了 HTML 和 CSS，我感到相当自信，直到我开始尝试完成一个项目。搭建一个作品集网站？小菜一碟！

离开了 freeCodeCamp 的编辑器我突然感到非常迷茫。从头开始写项目似乎变成了不可能的任务，我好像把学到的东西忘得一干二净了。我突然感觉自己不可能成为一名真正的程序员。

Finally asking for help was the best thing I did for myself. After stewing in my frustration for far too long, I reached out to a colleague who patiently guided me through using VS Code, structuring my HTML document, and linking it to a CSS file. After finally cobbling together a portfolio, I checked the box as done, even though I felt my work was terrible compared to others attempting this same challenge.

I eventually made my way into the JavaScript curriculum, which I had been impatiently waiting to start after about a month and half of struggling through HTML and CSS.

## Learning JavaScript

It started out easy enough, although it wasn't before long that I found myself lost and frustrated again. After completing all of the JavaScript modules, I felt I was lacking the confidence and tenacity to attempt the more difficult JavaScript projects. Instead, I took the easy way out and started through the Codecademy JavaScript curriculum.

It was certainly helpful in solidifying the basics for me – after all, repetition is key. However, the biggest mistake I made in my learning journey was not going back to attempt those challenges.

After working through all of the Codecademy modules, I started yet another JavaScript course, this time purchasing "The JavaScript Bootcamp" through Udemy. As this was my third time working through the fundamentals, I left that course with more stable footing and more confidence in my ability to work with JavaScript.

## Starting at Pleo

Pleo Team Camp, Dec 2019

From there, I jumped straight into another course, this time on Node directly followed up with a course on React.

Somewhere between the Node and React courses, I had started a new job as an account manager at what I still deem to be [Denmark's coolest startup][2]. It was and is incredibly exciting to be a part of a company growing so fast. It was even more exciting to meet so many new and talented developers to learn from.

About three months into my new job, my manager and I were discussing how my role could develop in the future. I was honest with her and said I wasn't interested in any further responsibility. I wanted to spend any and all excess capacity teaching myself to code, with the hopes of one day becoming a developer.

This is not something you want to hear from a relatively new sales rep on your team. But to my surprise, she was incredibly supportive and made a commitment to help me any way she could, as long as I hit my targets.

## Attempting the Coding Challenge

After speaking with one of our engineering directors, it was clear that for us to continue a conversation around what a transition from sales to product would look like, I would need to complete our frontend hiring challenge, like an outside candidate would.

The thought of attempting this was both incredibly intimidating and motivating. This is when I started staying late in the office every night. I didn't want to waste time biking home, so the second the clock hit 17:00, I would scurry to find some dinner, returning to my desk as soon as possible, to start my day pretending to be a developer.

I had finally finished my React course just before the Christmas holiday and was working on a few side-projects, although I never really followed through with any of them. I knew I needed to start applying my knowledge but found it difficult to complete a project without a real end goal.

With some extra time on my hands over the holiday period, I began to look through the frontend challenge again. I still felt far from capable to produce a worthy submission, however, I felt it gave me some sort of end goal to work towards so I could actually finish something.

Luckily for me, our frontend challenge was very similar to the final project of the React course, so I could reuse much of the boilerplate and components for my submission. I definitely felt like I was cheating.

But I sent through [my project][3] anyway and eagerly await feedback. Having my code reviewed by two of our senior engineers was incredibly scary and I was prepared for some harsh feedback.

After a couple weeks, my grade was in, and my submission wasn't a total failure! I had received some really great, actionable points of criticism. One of my colleagues even spent an hour with me after work, talking me through each line of feedback. Our code review session went so well, we decided to meet again, week after week, until well after I transitioned into becoming a developer.

## My First PR

My sales manager and the director of engineering continued to check in on my progress throughout the coming months. In April, the opportunity was presented that I could possibly work on the side with our internal tools team. There were many small, non-urgent tickets that needed attention in our back-office system.

I was excited – it would be a great way for me to get some real experience in working with the product team and it was made very clear this wasn't to interfere with my work in sales. That thought of working with real, production code was INSANE!

After a bit of coordination, an introduction to the team, and an invite to our company Github org, I was given my first ticket to work on.

I was to add an input to make a field editable for our compliance team. It was immediately clear I had no idea how to do this. Sure, I've added an input before and I knew vaguely how forms worked in React but this code felt like nothing I'd seen in any of my tutorials.

I was suddenly left with an ocean of questions. How does TypeScript work? What is a branch? How do I make a PR? What do all of these libraries do? How does my code even get built and sent to our users? What happens if I break something important?

It took me a couple days to get my bearings, but after much patience and help from the engineering lead, I managed to get two approvals and ship code to production. That was a huge milestone in my journey.

## Making the Switch

Over the next five months, I continued my routine of staying in the office late, working 09:00-17:00 in sales and 17:00 until whenever pretending to be a developer working with what I considered to be real code.

As you could expect, my desire to continue in sales dwindled every day and I started pressing to see if we could agree on a date for me to officially switch.

It certainly didn't go smoothly. No one had experience in what it means to move someone from sales to our product team. First and foremost, I had to be on target. I think that's true with most sales organisations – everything always comes back to making your quota.

After much back and forth, an agreement was made that I could officially make the switch August 1st, contingent that I remain on target. This was the light at the end of the tunnel for me. It was absolutely baffling to think I would soon be presented with an employment contract for my new role as a software engineer. The weeks leading up flew by. By 17:00, Wednesday, July 31, I was no longer an account manager.

There was definitely a transition period in getting used to my new role. It felt like being a stock broker working on the trading room floor to suddenly becoming a librarian.

Noise aside, there hasn't been a single day where I haven't been excited about coming into work. I've continued working in our internal tools team, building out our compliance and customer support back-office.

## What I learned

The experience I gained in sales is incredibly advantageous in my work today. Strong communication, time-management, and presentational skills have been invaluable as a dev. But I have found these to be lacking in most dev communities I've observed.

I realize I'm incredibly lucky to have been presented an opportunity to work with production code so early on. It was without a doubt a huge leap forward in my learning and massively helped in expediting my understanding of the realities of working as a dev that is impossible to gain from online tutorials*.*

Having a mentor to work with hugely accelerated my learning and was extremely helpful in keeping me accountable for always having a project on the go, so we always had something to work with. Without all of the support around me, I think I would still be spending all of my nights and weekends working through tutorials or building [random Pokemon generators][4].

I made a commitment early on to spend all of my free time continuing with my development. I think it's very easy to underestimate how large of a time commitment this journey is. Access to a mentor is a huge help, although even someone with enough knowledge to occasionally answer questions can save you hours of frustration. Don't be afraid to ask for help.

Looking retrospectively, I wish I would have spent more time building small projects and applying the things I learned. I frequently started projects but never followed through because I felt like I couldn't code something the correct way.

Spending time struggling through something has been way more helpful for my learning. There is certainly safety to staying on the rails of an interactive coding course but it can put a ceiling on your ability to apply your knowledge in the real world. I definitely fell into that trap.

It took me a while before a realized no one knows what the right way is, it's all made up. As a novice developer, there is value in a fresh perspective.

If there was one piece of advice I wish I had earlier on, it would have been to make a greater attempt to apply my knowledge as I learned. There is no such thing as real code or the correct way to do things, especially when you're learning. Any chance you have to apply your learnings along the way is valuable.

You're not a developer once someone pays you to be a developer, you're a developer the second you start coding.
