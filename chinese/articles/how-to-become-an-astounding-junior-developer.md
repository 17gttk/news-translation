If you're reading this, you probably just got your first tech job — so congratulations! Getting the first job is one of the hardest things you'll do in tech. There's so much work and effort already behind you.
如果你正在阅读这篇文章，你可能刚刚开始你的第一份工作，那么祝贺你！获得第一份工作是你在技术路上遇到的最为困难的事情之一。你也一定为此默默付出了很多努力。


Or maybe you don't have your first job yet, but you want to know what you should expect.
或许你还没有第一份工作，但是你想知道你所期待的。

Either way, in this post I will address the common worries and questions about what to expect on the job, and how to succeed in a career as a developer.
不管怎么样，在这篇文章中我将阐述一些常见的担忧和问题，比如在工作中应该期待什么，以及怎样在事业上成为一名成功的开发者。
Here's what we'll cover:
以下是我们将要讲的内容：

1.  What to expect on the job (early days/weeks)
1.在工作中可以期望什么（早期）
2.  Your short to medium-term plan
2.你的短期到中期计划
3.  The mindset for success
3.成功的心态
4.  How to be an outstanding new developer
4.如何成为一名杰出的初级开发者

## What to expect on the job
## 在工作中可以期待什么

The day finally arrives. You walk into the office (or join the morning team standup remotely) for the first time as a new developer. Even if you're nervous, try to remember and take in your first day. It's an exciting time!
这一天终于到来了。你第一次作为一名新的开发者走进办公室（不太懂什么意思）。即使你很紧张，也要记住和适应你的第一天。这是非常激动人心的时刻！

Your first day will likely be logistical things: setting up your computer, orientations or trainings, and HR logistics (banking information, insurance, and so on).
你工作的第一天很可能做流程上的事情：配置你的电脑，适应和培训，和一些人力资源方面的事情（如银行信息，保险等）。
However, it is becoming a common practice to have new developers do a push to production on your first day. It's usually something very small—like adding your name and photo or fixing a typo on the company website. This tests that your computer setup is good to go, and it also gives you a very quick win and lets you join the rest of the team shipping software.
然而，让新开发人员在第一天就推向生产是一种常见的做法。通常是一些小的事情，比如在公司网页上添加自己的名字和照片或者修复网页中的一个错字。这会测试你的计算机环境是否配备良好，并且它也会给你一个快速的胜利可以让你在未来更好的参加团队开发

### Your company wants you to succeed
### 你的公司希望你成功

As a new developer, the company that hired you knows the limitations of your current knowledge and skills. They understand they'll need to invest significant time into your growth to teach and train you.
作为一名新的开发人员，录用你的公司知道你目前的知识和技能的局限。他们知道为了你的成长他们需要投入大量的时间去教你和训练你。

Remember, this company  _wants you to succeed!_  They're on your side. This company went through enormous effort to find, interview, and hire you. It's a costly process from both a time and money perspective for the company. They're not going to hang you out to dry—that would be a poor way to treat their investment in you.
记住，公司想要你成长，他们在你这边。公司会投入大量的精力来发现、面试、录用你。对公司来讲，无论是在时间和金钱上都是一个昂贵的过程。他们不会把你晾到一边————那将是他们投资你的一种糟糕的方式。
There are some skills that you bring to the table at the start, but there are some skills that are difficult (though not impossible) to acquire outside of a professional work environment.
有些技能你一开始就能掌握，但是有些技能在专业环境之外获取是非常困难的（也不是不可能）。

Since this is your first job, it's likely you've never collaborated with a large team using source control or maintained production applications—and that's ok! These skills are easier to pick up in a production environment.
既然这是你的第一份工作，可能你从来没有与使用源代码管理工具或者维护生产应用程序的大团队合作过————这没有关系！这些技能在生产环境中是很容易学到的。

### Your first days/weeks
你的第一天/周

Once your computer is setup and you have access to all of the tools that you need, your first tasks will likely be small feature improvements or fixing small bugs—just things to get your wet feet across the various projects.
一旦你的电脑设置好了你可以使用所有你所需要的工具，你的第一个任务可能是一个小功能的改进或者处理一个小bug，这些只是让你在不同的项目中试水。

Outside of pure technical knowledge, in every company there is domain knowledge or "business logic" (what the company's products or services do and how they do it) that you'll need to pick up.
除了纯技术只是之外，每个公司都有你需要掌握的领域知识或者“业务逻辑”（公司做什么产品或服务并且他们是如何做的）。

If the company has multiple products, they may give you small tasks in each codebase to begin exploring those products. It's also likely that they will assign another person on the team to pair up with you—or at least be available for questions you have throughout the early weeks.
如果公司有多种产品，他们可能会在每个代码库中给你一些小任务让你去探索这些产品。可能他们会在团队中给你分配一个来带你或者在前数周可以为你解答问题的导师。

In these early days and weeks you only have one goal:  _learn, learn, learn._
在最初的日子里，你只有一个目标：那就是学习，学习，在学习。

Learn about the technology you're using, learn about the company and how it works, and learn how to work with your teammates. Your work output is not important at this point—your rate of growth is.
学习你正在使用的技术，学习公司是如何运转的，学习怎样和你组员协作。在这一阶段你的工作产出不重要，重要的是你的成长速度。

### Diving into a production codebase
### 深入到生产代码库中

As you begin working your way through the various codebases at your company, you'll likely feel a like a fish out of water. This is totally normal—it's  _much_  easier to write code than it is to read it.
当你开始在公司多样的代码库中工作的时候，你可能会觉得非常困难。这是非常正常的————写代码比读代码容易得多。

A production codebase is very different from the tutorials you've been working through or the toy projects you've been learning with.
生产代码相比你在学习过教程或者你学习的玩具项目有很大不同。

For one, this codebase has likely existed for many years, and been worked on by many different people—each with their own style and each of them making their own mistakes.
首先，生产代码可能存在了数年，期间由不同的人进行开发，他们有他们自己的编程风格并且犯了自己的错误。

It's also likely there are many more software packages or plugins injected into this application than you have come across before. All of the convenient shortcuts or edge cases that were ignored in a tutorial (like error handling) have to be handled here—this is a real app.
此外，嵌入到这个软件的软件包或者插件可能比你以前遇到的更多。所有的便利捷径或者可能会被教程文档忽略（比如错误处理）的边缘事例都要在这里进行处理，这是一个真正的应用程序。

This can be overwhelming at first, but reading other people's code is a skill you have to develop, and it's one you'll use your entire career (and at the end of this post I'll give you some tips to help with that).
一开始你可能会不知所措，但是阅读别人的代码是你必须提升的技能，你会在你的整个职业生涯中用到它（在文章结束的时候就此技能我会给你一些建议和帮助）

In the end, don't be afraid to ask for help! Your teammates are there to support you, and at some point in the past they had to ask the same exact questions.
最后，不要害怕寻求帮助！你的同事会支持你，在过去的某一个时候，他们可能也在问相同的问题。

### New developer expectations
### 新开发人员期望

First things first: this company is  _not_  expecting you to jump in and start knocking out features. They know you'll need time to develop skills you don't have yet, understand the codebases, and learn how to work with the team effectively.


It's likely your boss will meet with you and create a 30/60/90 day plan. If they don't do this—ask! Any supervisor will appreciate you owning your job and job expectations.
你的领导可能会与你碰面来制定30/60/80 天计划，如果他们不这样做，要求他这么做！任何领导都会欣赏你拥有自己的工作期望。

In the first 30 days, you'll likely just be doing small feature improvements and small bug fixes—just things to get to know the company's products and codebases. At 60 days, it's likely you'll be doing slightly larger features and bug fixes. By 90 days, the scope will have grown a little more, but they still won't expect you to own and drive large features forward yourself.
在起初30天，你可能通过写一个小需求或者处理一些小bug来熟悉公司产品和代码。60天的时候，你可能会做稍微大一点功能以及bug修复。到90天的时候，范围会扩大一点，但是他们还是不会期望你驾驭大的功能。

Ultimately, the company just wants you to continue to learn and absorb the information around you. You're not going to know everything going in, or after 90 days, and that's ok! Take it a day at a time.
从根本上，公司希望你能不断学习和吸收身边的信息。你不可能什么都知道，也不可能在90天后都知道，没关系！一天天慢慢来。

### The new developer mindset
### 新开发者的心态

Walking into a new company, there are many things you can't control, but there is one very important thing you can: your mindset.  **Your daily thoughts, practices, and how you internalize what happens around you will determine your success.**
步入新的公司，有很多东西你没法控制，但是有一个你可以控制的非常重要的事情，那就是你的心态。 **你每天所想、实践以及你如何内化发生在你身边的事情将决定你的成功。**

At times you'll be confused, at times you'll feel overwhelmed, and at times you'll even doubt if you can do this (I did). How you internalize these thoughts matters. Remember, this isn't unique to you—every new developer has faced this. Keep your mind in check and you'll push through.
有时候你会困惑，有时候你会感到不知所措，有时候你甚至会怀疑你是否能做到（我做到了）。你如何消化这些想法很重要。记住，这些问题不仅只有你会遇到，所有新开发者都要面对。保持冷静，你会成功的。

When you run into something confusing or frustrating, re-position your mind:  _this obstacle is a learning opportunity._
当你遇到令你困惑或沮丧的事情时，端正你的想法：这个障碍是一个学习的机会。

It's an opportunity to understand something new and grow. It sucks, it feels bad, but soon after this you will be a better developer. And this will happen a lot—that's just the reality of being new to something.
这是一个了解新事物和成长的机会。这个过程中你可能会很痛苦，但不久之后，你会成为一名好的开发者。这就是接受新事物时的现实。

Instead of internalizing:

> _"I got stuck 10 times today."_
我今天被困住了10次。

Try instead:

> _"I had 10 opportunities to learn today."_
今天我有10次机会去学习。

It's a powerful shift, and it will be obvious to your teammates and in your job performance.
这是非常有力的转变，对你同事以及你的工作表现而言这会非常明显。

Staying on top of your mind and not allowing the feeling of defeat to creep in will not only help you perform better in the situation, but it also increases the knowledge and skill you leave the situation with. Take a deep breath, take a break, ask for help—but keep pushing through.
保持头脑清醒，不要让失败的感觉悄悄潜入，这不仅能帮助你在这种情况下表现得更好，而且还能增加你离开这种情况时的知识和技能。深呼吸，慢慢来，寻求帮助并坚持下去。

And then at the end of the day: shrug it all off. Drop it on the ground when you leave the office or close your computer for the day. Start the next day fresh and ready for its own adventures.
在一天结束的时候，一笑置之。在你离开办公室或者关闭电脑的时候，把它忘了。开始全新的第二天，准备迎接新挑战。

Also, remember to celebrate the little wins along the way! Those small wins will stack up and become a large mountain of success over time.
还有，记住庆祝一路走来的小的成功！随着时间的推移，这些小成功会累计成为一个巨大的成功之山。

Here's another important thing to remember:  **give yourself the freedom to make mistakes.**  You're going to break production, you're going to make some bad database updates (I definitely have)—it's recoverable, it's not the end of the world or your job, and any experienced developer has done it. It's just a part of the process.
还有一件重要的事情你要记住：**给你自己犯错误的空间。** 你会搞乱代码，你会做一些糟糕的数据库更新（我肯定有）——这些都是可以恢复的，这不是世界末日，也不是你工作的结束，任何有经验的开发人员都做犯这些错误。

### Your greatest skill as a new developer
### 作为一名新的开发者你最好的技能

You may not realize it, but your greatest skill as a new developer is that you've  **learned how to learn.**
你可能没有意识到，作为一名新的开发人员最好的技能是**学习如何去学习**。

You've learned how to take something hard, complex, obscure, and break it into pieces—work through it step by step.
你已经学会了如何处理困难、复杂、模糊的问题并将它分成块并一步一步的解决。

More than learning JavaScript, React, Ruby, or anything else, the best thing you've learned is how to teach yourself. Take this practiced skill you have and show up with it every single day.
无论你学JavaScript、React、Ruby或者其他任何东西，你学到最好的事情是如何自学。多利用你掌握的这个技能并每以天都实践出来。

## Own your growth—no one else will.
## 拥有你的成长

This might be the most important statement for a developer at any stage of their career:  **your career is your own. You have to own it, and you have to own your growth.**
对于一个处于职业生涯任何阶段的开发人员来说，这可能是最重要的：**你的事业是你自己的。你必须拥有它，你必须拥有你的成长。**

Sometimes the your company, job position, or boss will help facilitate your growth, but in the end, it's up to you.
有时你的公司、职位或老板会帮助你成长，但最终还是由你自己决定。

Most companies have some kind of scheduled review process—possibly quarterly or yearly. If they do, great, but if they don't, own your growth! Ask your supervisor regularly for feedback, and do what they say. If someone mentions something you've never heard of, ask them about it or go do your own research it!
大多数公司都有某种固定的审查程序——可能是季度或年度。如果他们有，那很好，如果没有，拥有自己的成长！定期征求上司的意见，并按他们说的去做。如果有人提到了你从未听说过的东西，问问他们，或者自己去研究一下!

### "The Power of Tiny Gains"
### 微小收益的力量

![https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer.027.jpeg)

https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains

One of my favorite books,  [_Atomic Habits_  by James Clear,][1]  has a great diagram titled "The Power of Tiny Gains." It's a simple diagram. It shows the difference between a 1%  _improvement_  and 1%  _decline_  every day.
我最喜欢的一本书之一——《小习惯 詹姆斯·克莱尔》[1] 有一个非常棒的图表标题 “微小收益的力量”。这是一个简单的图表。它显示了每天1%的改善和1%的下降之间的差异。

If you get 1% better every day, after a year you'll be almost 38 times better than you were at the start of the year! That's the power of "tiny gains," and it's just as true for becoming a great software developer.
如果你每天都有1%的改善，一年之后，你会比年初好38倍!这就是“微小收益”的力量，对于成为一名伟大的软件开发人员来说也是如此。

Every day you have an opportunity to learn something new—no matter how tiny it is. Maybe it's a new function on arrays you didn't know about, a different method for structuring CSS, a new text editor shortcut, or something new entirely like learning SQL and how data is stored at the database level.
每天你都有机会学习新东西，不管它有多小。也许是一个您不知道的数组上的新函数，一种不同的CSS结构化方法，一个新的文本编辑器快捷方式，或者是一些全新的东西，比如学习SQL以及如何在数据库级别存储数据。

Regardless, aim to be 1% better every day (most days you'll end up doing much more) and the growth from the first few years of your career will be astounding.
无论如何，每天提高1%(大多数日子你会做得更多)，你职业生涯最初几年的成长将是惊人的。

### One page per day
### 每天一页

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-29-at-10.10.23-AM.png)

I heard a story on a developer podcast once about the guy who maintains the  `pg`  gem for Ruby. This is the gem that is the interface between your Ruby code and the Postgresql database. It's some pretty serious stuff, and it's used by most Ruby developers every single day.
我曾经在一个博客上听说过一个故事，讲的是一位维护Ruby的`pg` gem。这是Ruby和Postgresql之间的一个接口。这是一个相当严肃的事情，因为大多数Ruby开发人员每天都在使用它。

The story of how he became the maintainer of this gem was interesting. He said that when he was first getting started, he would open up the Postgresql documentation and read one page—just one page each and every day.
他如何成为gem的维护者的故事非常有趣。他说当他刚开始的时候，他会打开Postgresql文档并阅读一页——每天只读一页。

Over time, he grew an extensive knowledge of Postgresql and was able to start contributing to the  `pg`  gem. After a little while longer, he became the maintainer of that gem.随着时间的推移，他对Postgresql有了广泛的了解，并开始为“pg”gem做出贡献。过了一段时间，他成为了gem的维护者。

It's the perfect example of tiny gains stacking up—just one page per day. Any of us can do that, and I encourage you to take the same philosophy and apply it to whatever language or system you're working with!
这是积累点滴的完美例子——每天一页就够了。我们每个人都可以做到这一点，我鼓励你将同样的理念应用到你正在使用的任何语言或系统中!
### "Practice make perfect"
### 实践出真知

You've probably heard this phase before:  _"practice makes perfect."_
你以前可能听说过这个短语:实践出真知。

My piano teacher growing up used a different phrase:  _"**perfect**  practice makes perfect."_
我的钢琴老师使用了不同的短语：**完美**的实践出真知。

I think he was right. I could practice the piano in the wrong way—with bad technique, sloppy, without a steady rhythm—and that's the result I would get: sloppy piano playing.
我认为他说的对，我可能会用错误的方式练习钢琴——糟糕的技术，马虎，没有稳定的节奏——结果就是:马虎的钢琴演奏。

It's not just practice, but  _how_  you practice that matters. I could practice the first measure of a song over and over and get it down perfectly, but if I never pushed beyond the first measure I would never learn the song. I could play that first measure of the song at the level of a world-class pianist, but I wanted to  _play_  the piano, so I had to learn the whole song.
重要的不只是实践，而是你如何实践。我可以一遍又一遍地练习一首歌曲的第一小节，并把它写得很完美，但如果我只关注第一小节，我就永远学不会这首歌。我可以以世界级钢琴家的水平演奏这首歌的第一小节，但我想弹钢琴，所以我不得不学习整首歌。

This is a perfect parallel for development. The way you "practice" development (your daily habits, methods and routines for development) determines the type of developer you will become.
这对于开发来说是一个完美的对比。你实践开发的方式(你的日常习惯、开发方法和常规)决定了你将成为什么样的开发人员。

In the beginning you'll make lots of mistakes (everyone does), but if you're conscious of your work, you'll notice areas you can improve. These are perfect practice moments: the opportunity to learn something new or do something in a better way.
一开始你会犯很多错误(每个人都会犯)，但是如果你对你的工作上心，你就会发现你有可以改进的地方。这些都是完美的练习时刻:学习新东西或以更好的方式做某事的机会。

When you look back on your career ten years from now, you will want to have had ten years of growth, practice, and learning—not one year of growth, practice, and learning ten times.
当你从现在开始回顾十年的职业生涯时，你想要的应该是十年的成长、实践和学习，而不是一年的成长、实践和学习经历十次。

So ask those dumb questions. Ask the obvious questions. When someone mentions something you don't know anything about, boldly ask, "What's that?" My hope is that they respond in a kind and teaching manner, but regardless, be ready to learn.
所以去问那些愚蠢的问题。问那些可能显而易见的问题。当别人提到一些你不知道的事情时，大胆地问:“那是什么?”我希望他们能以一种和蔼可亲的方式回应我，无论如何，你都要做好学习的准备。

It all comes back to owning your growth.
这一切都会见证你的成长。

## T-shaped people
## T字型的人

![A "T-shaped" person](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer2.001.jpeg)

A "T-shaped" person
一个T字型的人

In the beginning of your development career, there are so many topics that you can benefit from knowing, so you want to spread your effort and knowledge across a wide range of subjects.
在您的开发生涯开始时，您可以从了解许多主题中获益，因此您希望将您的努力和知识传播到广泛的主题中。

If you're aiming at becoming a full-stack developer, that list might include things like HTML, CSS, JS, a backend language of your choice, SQL, Git, etc. There's so much easily attainable knowledge and benefit right on the surface of each of those topics that can be acquired by casting a wide net and taking it all in.

Over time, you'll find what type of development you enjoy most. Maybe it's frontend, backend, database work, ops, design—or some combination of those and more.

As your career progresses, you'll start to become a "T-shaped person." A T-shaped person is someone who, like the letter "T" is visualized, has a wide but shallow knowledge and experience about a lot of things, and a couple areas with a deep amount of knowledge and experience.

This deep knowledge takes a while to build up, and each step down is increasingly more effort than the previous—that's just the reality as you approach mastery of a subject. In the beginning, scoop up all of those easier beginner gains across a wide field of subjects.

Having this T-shape ability will help you become a better developer as a whole. Frontend developers who understand the database schema or backend developers who understand how those database tables are going to be used as models in the frontend will be more knowledgeable and better teammates than those who are siloed in their own area.

In the beginning this little foray into all of the aspects of development is also useful to find what you're drawn to, and to give you the bigger picture of all of the moving pieces in the software world.

Follow your interests and stay hungry to learn!
追随你的兴趣，保持求知欲!

## Tips for being a great new developer
## 为新开发者的一个建议

Now that we've covered your expectations and how to think about them, here's some practical tips to make you a great new developer—one your teammates love to work with.

### #1 Communicate really really really really really really well
### #1 沟通是非常非常好的

You may not have incredible development knowledge and skill walking into your first day, but you  _can_ have incredible communication skills.
第一天上班时，你可能没有令人难以置信的开发知识和技能，但你可以有令人难以置信的沟通技巧。

As a new developer, you're going to ask for help and guidance—a lot. And that's ok! Here's a tip for how to ask for help effectively.
作为一名新开发人员，您将需要大量的帮助和指导。没关系，这里有一个如何有效地寻求帮助的小窍门。

Getting stuck is frustrating (it was for me). In these moments, it's easy to let that frustration overwhelm you and fire off questions to your teammate next to you (or maybe via email or a chat app).
被困住是令人沮丧的(对我来说就是这样)。这种挫败感很容易将你压倒，你可以向旁边的同事抛出问题(或者通过电子邮件或聊天应用)。

Things like:
类似：

> "im stuck"  
> 我困住了
> "it errored"  
> 显示错误
> "the page won't load"
> 页面不能加载

Now take a step back and view this from the perspective of the person you're asking help from. A message like  _"the page won't load"_  doesn't help this person help you at all. There's no context. There's no information for them to go on. In fact, they have to  _ask for more information from you._  This is incredibly inefficient and very frustrating for the person that is trying to help you.
现在退一步，从你请求帮助的那个人的角度来看待这个问题。像_“页面无法加载”_这样的信息对这个人毫无帮助。没有上下文。没有信息可以让他们继续。事实上，他们还得向你获取更多的信息。这样做效率非常低，而且会让试图帮助你的人非常沮丧。

A better way to ask for help is to think of it like a  [Mad Lib][2]™ (if you remember those):
寻求帮助的一个更好的方式是像[Mad Lib][2]™一样思考(如果你还记得的话):

> I am working on \_\_\_\_\_,  
> 我正在做 \_\_\_\_\_,
> but when I try \_\_\_\_\_,  
> 但是在我尝试\_\_\_\_\_的时候，
> \_\_\_\_\_ happens instead. 
>却发生了这个。
>   
> I've tried \_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_.  
> 我试着\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_,和\_\_\_\_\_.
> and I've looked at \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_
> 我发现\_\_\_\_\_ 和 \_\_\_\_\_

An example of this message might be something like this:
这条信息的一个例子可能是这样的:

> I am working on  **the user password reset bug**, 
> 我正在处理**用户密码重置错误的bug**，
> but when I try  **to generate a password reset link**,  
> 但是当我**尝试生成密码重置链接时**，
> **the user's token is already empty**.  
> **用户的令牌已经为空**
>   
> I've looked at  **where the token is set**, and  **I can see the token in the database**,  
> 我看过**令牌是在哪设的**，我发现**令牌在数据库中**
> but  **the token is missing on line X of File Y.**
> 但是 **这个令牌在文件Y的X行上丢失了。**

If you sent someone the message above, they can understand:
如果你给别人发了上面的信息，他们可以理解:

-   What you're working on
- 你在做什么
-   What the problem is
- 问题是什么
-   What you've  _tried already_
- 你已经试过了什么
-   Where the problem is
- 问题发生在哪

This is a wealth of information for the person you're asking help from. They will  **greatly**  appreciate that you gave them that information so clearly—and that you've already  _tried to fix it yourself._  This shows them that you respect their time, and you're not just looking for an easy handout.
对于你寻求帮助的人来说，这是一个丰富的信息。他们会**非常**感谢你给了他们如此清晰的信息，并且_你已经尝试自己去解决它_.这让他们知道你尊重他们的时间，而不是简单的施舍。

There's nothing wrong with getting help, but if someone just fixes the problem for you they've really robbed you of the opportunity to learn and grow yourself.
寻求帮助并没有错，但是如果有人只是帮你解决问题，他们实际上是在剥夺你学习和成长的机会。

It's not like there's ten problems you have to work through and you're done for the rest of your life—you'll face problems every single day as a developer. So the best outcome is if they give you enough help to get you unstuck but allow you to solve the problem yourself.

### #2 Hone your Google Fu

Just like developing skill in the physical martial art of Kung Fu, over time as a developer you will develop skill in the art of Google Fu—that is the art of finding answers by Googling them. This is a real skill that every experienced developer has and it is developed over time.

Sometimes, you just need to google the exact problem you have (this works great with error messages):

![Sometimes pasting the whole error message works](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer.041.jpeg)

Sometimes pasting the whole error message works

Sometimes googling the exact error message will produce the correct result, as it did above. You ran into a technical problem, and someone else ran into the exact same problem.

But sometimes, you need to edit the search query a little bit to remove project-specific info:

![Too much project-specific info returns no results](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer.042-1.jpeg)

Too much project-specific info returns no results

In the image above, Google has never seen the function  `whos_that_pokemon_its_pikachu()`  in the file  `gotta_catchem_all.rb`  (except now it has since I searched it :)). Removing that project-specific info and adding generic info returns better results.

![The underlying generic error](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer.043-1.jpeg)

The underlying generic error

### #3 Use a "try timer"

As a new developer you're going to get stuck a lot. There will be error messages you haven't seen before, and how you handle these situations will determine how quickly you grow as a developer.
作为一名新开发人员，你会遇到很多困难。可能会出现以前你从未见过的错误消息，如何处理这些情况将决定您作为开发人员的成长速度。

Although these can be terribly frustrating moments, these are the moments where you will learn and you will grow. You don't learn by doing the same kind of work over and over again—it's by journeying through these bumps in the road that growth takes place.
尽管这可能是非常令人沮丧的时刻，这些是你学习和成长的时刻。

When you run into one of these problems, take some time to try and figure it out yourself. Some companies will tell you this as a part of onboarding—something like  _"try for 30min before asking for help."_  In other companies it's not as clearly defined, but the message is still there: do your best and then if you're still stuck ask for help.

This not only allows you the opportunity to figure it out and learn for yourself, but it also respects the time of your teammates who are focused on their own work. Interrupting someone for something you could have quickly figured out yourself is a net loss for the team.

So give it a good try, and then of course ask for help!

Here's the secret to being a great new developer though:  **always reset the timer.**

Let's say you get stuck, try for 30min, and then ask for help. The next time you get stuck  **try again for another 30min**  before asking for help.

This may seem obvious, but on those days where it feels like you hit nothing but problem after problem, you're going to get frustrated and you're going to want to start asking for help as soon as the next problem arrives—it's just natural.

Take a deep breath, go for a quick walk, and approach each problem with a fresh perspective.

(This is, of course, easier said than done!)

### #4 Remember to relax and take breaks!
### #4 记住放松和休息！

Remember to take breaks when things start to feel overwhelming.
记住，当事情开始让你感到难以承受时，要休息一下。

Go for a walk. Go get a glass of water. Sleep on it if you can. Sometimes just getting up and moving for a minute can help you re-center yourself.
去散个步。接杯水。如果可以的话，放一个晚上。有时候仅仅睡一觉或者动一动就可以帮助你重新调整自己。

Remember that every developer was once in your place, and you will get through it.
请记住，每个开发人员都曾经历过你这种情形，您会度过难关的。

Development will always be frustrating to some extent—you never stop making mistakes or running into problems. But over time you just get better at dealing with them, and your confidence to fix those problems increases so it bothers you less and less.

### #5 Ask the duck

Have you ever written an email or a text message describing a problem you have to someone, and right before you hit send you realize the solution? In the software world there's a phrase for this—[_rubber duck debugging_][3]:

> The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.

You see, by writing an email or talking to another person, you're forced to explain the entire context in a logical way in order for the other person to understand what's going on.

To explain the problem in this way,  _you yourself_  have to be able to think about and order it logically. Just the act of trying to prepare this context for someone else can cause you to think about the problem in a different light, and many times you'll find the solution yourself.

So relating back to using a try timer, before you ask for help, try explaining (or typing) up the summary of the problem in an email that you don't send. The chances are you'll gain new insight about the problem without having to interrupt another person, and worst case, you've got a great email or chat message to send them.

(I've seen many people put actual rubber ducks on their desk too!)

### #6 Take notes

This tip may seem obvious...but take notes!

You will be introduced to many different things when you first join a company: codebases, products, people, business logic, and it will be impossible to remember it all. Write this stuff down.

When I started my first job, my boss told me he had no problem explaining anything to me, but he didn't want to have to do it twice. I understood then, but now eight years later I really understand—it's all about respecting your teammates and their time.

If he explains something to me and I forget it, we've wasted both of our time—_and_  I'll have to ask him again. At his recommendation I even started putting physical sticky notes on my monitor of things I wanted to see often and remember. Things like:

> \- TRY FOR 30MIN  
> \- CHECK THE BUILD PASSES BEFORE ASKING FOR PR REVIEW  
> \- MAKE SURE YOU HAVE LATEST CODE

### #7 Fight against imposter syndrome daily

If you don't know what imposter syndrome is, it sounds like this in your head:

> I don't belong. I'm a fraud. Everyone else understands this but me.

This is a mindset you have to fight on a daily basis. There will be frustrating times as a developer, but you've faced frustration already and pushed through it. Every developer has felt this, and this too will pass.

In reality, imposter syndrome looks more like this:

## The one key difference between a "senior" and "junior" developer

Sure, a senior developer has more knowledge and experience than a new developer, but that isn't what sets them apart. A senior developer has a  **problem solving system.**

When I first started in development I thought eventually I would stop making mistakes—that I would stop running into errors.

The opposite happened. I still make an incredible number of mistakes every day. Wrong syntax, wrong file, wrong function.

I didn't stop making mistakes—_I just got incredibly fast at fixing them._

This is a skill that is developed over time, and it requires intentional problem solving.

Here's some tips on how to build this system.

## 5 Debugging tips
## 5 调试技巧

### #1 Don't thrash your code!
### #1 不要盲目修改代码

One of the things I did as a new developer—and something I see many other new developers do when they run into a problem—is they start wildly changing things in their code. Instead of having a systematic evaluation process, they just make a ton of quick changes trying to see if that fixes the problem.
我看到许多新开发人员遇到问题时会开始疯狂的开始改代码（我是新开发者的时候我也这么做过）。他们没有系统的代码评估过程，只是对代码做大量的修改，看看这样是否能解决问题。

This is a very bad habit. You will only create more mistakes doing this. What you should do is:
这是一个很坏的习惯。这样做只会犯更多的错误。你应该做的是:

### #2 Read the error message!
### #2 读错误信息

This tip may seem obvious, but actually  _read_  the message. What is the error? What is the file where this error is occurring? What  _line_  is this error coming from? This is all vital information.
这个建议似乎很明显，但实际上是在读取信息。错误是什么？发生这个错误的文件是什么?错误产生在哪一行？这些都是至关重要的信息。

If you resist just changing your code rapidly, you can jump  **straight to the exact place the error is happening.**
如果您不愿意快速更改代码的话，你可以直接**跳到错误产生的地方**

This is what the experienced developer does. Read the message—go straight to the problem.
这是有经验的开发人员所做的。读取消息然后直接找到问题所在。

Doing this will save you an incredible amount of wasted time and mental effort.
这样做会为你节省大量的时间和精力。

### #3 Don't waste time on the impossible! (Or at least the improbable)
## #3 不要把时间浪费在不可能的事情上（或者是至少不可能的事情）

![Don't waste time on the impossible!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer.059.jpeg)

Don't waste time on the impossible!
不要把时间浪费在不可能的事情上！

This is something I see new developers do often. They face an error in their code, they find something that they think is the problem, and they can't believe how it's not true. As an example:
我看到的新开发人员会经常做这样一件事。举个例子：

> "I see the problem is on line 14, where it checks if the  `is_admin`  variable is  `true`, and it's not  `true`—but the user  _**is**_  an admin!!
> "我发现问题出现在第14行，它会检查"is_admin"变量是否为真，但是它不是真，然而管理员确实是管理员！

They approach this problem thinking,  _"How can this be!!!"_  instead of,  _"How can this be?"_
他们是这么思考这个问题，“这怎么可以！”，而不是“为什么会这样？”

There are times when you will encounter a core language or framework bug, but 99.9% of the time,  **you did something wrong or the situation is not as it appears.**
有时候你会遇到核心语言或框架的bug，但99.9%的情况下， **你可能是做错了什么，或者情况并不像看上去的那样。**

Instead of spending time marveling at the impossible unfolding before your eyes, question your assumptions about the situation. Something is not as it seems. Being aghast at the impossible is only a waste of time—start your problem-solving system.有些事并不像看上去的那样。被不可能的事情吓到只是在浪费时间，开始解决问题。
不要再眼前不可能展开的事情上花时间，质疑你对情况的假设。

### #4 "When in doubt, print more out." - Some wise person
### #4 “当有疑问时，打印更多的信息” ——一些明智的人

I don't know who originally said this, but it's one of the most effective debugging techniques out there. When you don't know what's happening, start printing the state of your program in places where you think the problem is happening.
我不知道最初是谁说的，但这是最有效的调试技术之一。当你不知道发生了什么情况时，开始在你认为发生问题的地方打印程序的相应信息。

What is in the  `user`  variable? What is the response from the HTTP request? Did we take the  `if`  or the  `else`  branch in this situation? Did we even call this function or are we even on this page?
' user '变量中有什么?HTTP请求的响应是什么?在这种情况下，我们使用了if或else分支吗?我们调用过这个函数吗?是否在此页面?

I've seen countless developers trying to debug and fix an issue (and I've done it many times myself too) when they weren't even working in the right file! A quick  `print`  or  `console.log`  will show you that you are in fact looking at the actual code being run.
我见过无数的开发人员尝试调试和修复一个问题的时候(我自己也做过很多次)，他们甚至没有在正确的文件中进行调试!快速“打印”或者在“控制台”中可以显示您实际上正在查看实际运行的代码。

### #5 Take it  _one_  step at a time.
### #5 一次做一件事。

A common mistake every new developer does:  **they do too much at once.**
每个新开发人员都会犯的一个常见错误是:**他们一次做的事情太多了。**

They want to write code for 30min, click run, and see it work. What they find is that they spent 30min writing bugs and errors, and it's now a nightmare to fix.
他们想要编写30分钟的代码，单击运行，然后查看结果。他们发现，他们花了30分钟来编写bug和错误，现在修复起来简直是一场噩梦。

When I go to make a new page in an app, the first thing I do is put  `<p>hi</p>`  on the page. I want to make sure that all of my internal code is setup correctly and I see that  `hi`  on the page. I take it one. step. at. a. time.
当我在应用程序中新建一个页面时，我做的第一件事就是把`<p>hi</p>`放到页面上。我想确定我所有内部代码设置是正确的以至我可以在页面上看到`hi`。我一次只做一件事。

Do one thing at a time. Get  _"hi"_  printing on the page. Next get the user input. Next validate the input. Next save the input. If you take small steps you know exactly where to fix the problem when it occurs.
一次只做一件事。在页面上看到“hi”显示。接下来获取用户输入。接下来保存输入。如果你一步一步来，你就知道问题发生在哪里，该如何解决。

Even eight years later into a development career I still take it step by step. I know I'm going to make a ton of mistakes, and I want to know  _immediately_  when and where that happens.
即使在从事开发工作8年后，我仍然是一步一步来。我知道我将会犯很多错误，而且我想知道这些错误在何时何地发生。

## Conclusion
## 总结

You've already come so far, but there's still a lot ahead of you.
你已经走了很远，但是还有很多路需要你去走。

There's much to learn, and many skills to develop, but there's also a lot of fun and rewarding work ahead as well!
你还有很多知识得学，很多技能需要提升，但是也有很多乐趣和有益的工作在等着你。

Keep your head up, and remember to take breaks. Get 1% better every day, and in a year you'll be astonished at the results!
抬头挺胸，记得要休息。每天提高1%，一年之后你就会对结果感到惊讶!
