If you're reading this, you probably just got your first tech job — so congratulations! Getting the first job is one of the hardest things you'll do in tech. There's so much work and effort already behind you.
如果你正在阅读这篇文章，你可能刚刚开始你的第一份工作，那么祝贺你！获得第一份工作是你在技术路上遇到的最为困难的事情之一。你也一定为此默默付出了很多努力。


Or maybe you don't have your first job yet, but you want to know what you should expect.
或许你还没有第一份工作，但是你想知道你所期待的。

Either way, in this post I will address the common worries and questions about what to expect on the job, and how to succeed in a career as a developer.
不管怎么样，在这篇文章中我将阐述一些常见的担忧和问题，比如在工作中应该期待什么，以及怎样在事业上成为一名成功的开发者。
Here's what we'll cover:
以下是我们将要讲的内容：

1.  What to expect on the job (early days/weeks)
1.在工作中可以期望什么（早期）
2.  Your short to medium-term plan
2.你的短期到中期计划
3.  The mindset for success
3.成功的心态
4.  How to be an outstanding new developer
4.如何成为一名杰出的初级开发者

## What to expect on the job
## 在工作中可以期待什么

The day finally arrives. You walk into the office (or join the morning team standup remotely) for the first time as a new developer. Even if you're nervous, try to remember and take in your first day. It's an exciting time!
这一天终于到来了。你第一次作为一名新的开发者走进办公室（不太懂什么意思）。即使你很紧张，也要记住和适应你的第一天。这是非常激动人心的时刻！

Your first day will likely be logistical things: setting up your computer, orientations or trainings, and HR logistics (banking information, insurance, and so on).
你工作的第一天很可能做流程上的事情：配置你的电脑，适应和培训，和一些人力资源方面的事情（如银行信息，保险等）。
However, it is becoming a common practice to have new developers do a push to production on your first day. It's usually something very small—like adding your name and photo or fixing a typo on the company website. This tests that your computer setup is good to go, and it also gives you a very quick win and lets you join the rest of the team shipping software.
然而，让新开发人员在第一天就推向生产是一种常见的做法。通常是一些小的事情，比如在公司网页上添加自己的名字和照片或者修复网页中的一个错字。这会测试你的计算机环境是否配备良好，并且它也会给你一个快速的胜利可以让你在未来更好的参加团队开发

### Your company wants you to succeed
### 你的公司希望你成功

As a new developer, the company that hired you knows the limitations of your current knowledge and skills. They understand they'll need to invest significant time into your growth to teach and train you.
作为一名新的开发人员，录用你的公司知道你目前的知识和技能的局限。他们知道为了你的成长他们需要投入大量的时间去教你和训练你。

Remember, this company  _wants you to succeed!_  They're on your side. This company went through enormous effort to find, interview, and hire you. It's a costly process from both a time and money perspective for the company. They're not going to hang you out to dry—that would be a poor way to treat their investment in you.
记住，公司想要你成长，他们在你这边。公司会投入大量的精力来发现、面试、录用你。对公司来讲，无论是在时间和金钱上都是一个昂贵的过程。他们不会把你晾到一边————那将是他们投资你的一种糟糕的方式。
There are some skills that you bring to the table at the start, but there are some skills that are difficult (though not impossible) to acquire outside of a professional work environment.
有些技能你一开始就能掌握，但是有些技能在专业环境之外获取是非常困难的（也不是不可能）。

Since this is your first job, it's likely you've never collaborated with a large team using source control or maintained production applications—and that's ok! These skills are easier to pick up in a production environment.
既然这是你的第一份工作，可能你从来没有与使用源代码管理工具或者维护生产应用程序的大团队合作过————这没有关系！这些技能在生产环境中是很容易学到的。

### Your first days/weeks
你的第一天/周

Once your computer is setup and you have access to all of the tools that you need, your first tasks will likely be small feature improvements or fixing small bugs—just things to get your wet feet across the various projects.
一旦你的电脑设置好了你可以使用所有你所需要的工具，你的第一个任务可能是一个小功能的改进或者处理一个小bug，这些只是让你在不同的项目中试水。

Outside of pure technical knowledge, in every company there is domain knowledge or "business logic" (what the company's products or services do and how they do it) that you'll need to pick up.
除了纯技术只是之外，每个公司都有你需要掌握的领域知识或者“业务逻辑”（公司做什么产品或服务并且他们是如何做的）。

If the company has multiple products, they may give you small tasks in each codebase to begin exploring those products. It's also likely that they will assign another person on the team to pair up with you—or at least be available for questions you have throughout the early weeks.
如果公司有多种产品，他们可能会在每个代码库中给你一些小任务让你去探索这些产品。可能他们会在团队中给你分配一个来带你或者在前数周可以为你解答问题的导师。

In these early days and weeks you only have one goal:  _learn, learn, learn._
在最初的日子里，你只有一个目标：那就是学习，学习，在学习。

Learn about the technology you're using, learn about the company and how it works, and learn how to work with your teammates. Your work output is not important at this point—your rate of growth is.
学习你正在使用的技术，学习公司是如何运转的，学习怎样和你组员协作。在这一阶段你的工作产出不重要，重要的是你的成长速度。

### Diving into a production codebase
### 深入到生产代码库中

As you begin working your way through the various codebases at your company, you'll likely feel a like a fish out of water. This is totally normal—it's  _much_  easier to write code than it is to read it.
当你开始在公司多样的代码库中工作的时候，你可能会觉得非常困难。这是非常正常的————写代码比读代码容易得多。

A production codebase is very different from the tutorials you've been working through or the toy projects you've been learning with.
生产代码相比你在学习过教程或者你学习的玩具项目有很大不同。

For one, this codebase has likely existed for many years, and been worked on by many different people—each with their own style and each of them making their own mistakes.
首先，生产代码可能存在了数年，期间由不同的人进行开发，他们有他们自己的编程风格并且犯了自己的错误。

It's also likely there are many more software packages or plugins injected into this application than you have come across before. All of the convenient shortcuts or edge cases that were ignored in a tutorial (like error handling) have to be handled here—this is a real app.
此外，嵌入到这个软件的软件包或者插件可能比你以前遇到的更多。所有的便利捷径或者可能会被教程文档忽略（比如错误处理）的边缘事例都要在这里进行处理，这是一个真正的应用程序。

This can be overwhelming at first, but reading other people's code is a skill you have to develop, and it's one you'll use your entire career (and at the end of this post I'll give you some tips to help with that).
一开始你可能会不知所措，但是阅读别人的代码是你必须提升的技能，你会在你的整个职业生涯中用到它（在文章结束的时候就此技能我会给你一些建议和帮助）

In the end, don't be afraid to ask for help! Your teammates are there to support you, and at some point in the past they had to ask the same exact questions.
最后，不要害怕寻求帮助！你的同事会支持你，在过去的某一个时候，他们可能也在问相同的问题。

### New developer expectations
### 新开发人员期望

First things first: this company is  _not_  expecting you to jump in and start knocking out features. They know you'll need time to develop skills you don't have yet, understand the codebases, and learn how to work with the team effectively.


It's likely your boss will meet with you and create a 30/60/90 day plan. If they don't do this—ask! Any supervisor will appreciate you owning your job and job expectations.
你的领导可能会与你碰面来制定30/60/80 天计划，如果他们不这样做，要求他这么做！任何领导都会欣赏你拥有自己的工作期望。

In the first 30 days, you'll likely just be doing small feature improvements and small bug fixes—just things to get to know the company's products and codebases. At 60 days, it's likely you'll be doing slightly larger features and bug fixes. By 90 days, the scope will have grown a little more, but they still won't expect you to own and drive large features forward yourself.
在起初30天，你可能通过写一个小需求或者处理一些小bug来熟悉公司产品和代码。60天的时候，你可能会做稍微大一点功能以及bug修复。到90天的时候，范围会扩大一点，但是他们还是不会期望你驾驭大的功能。

Ultimately, the company just wants you to continue to learn and absorb the information around you. You're not going to know everything going in, or after 90 days, and that's ok! Take it a day at a time.
从根本上，公司希望你能不断学习和吸收身边的信息。你不可能什么都知道，也不可能在90天后都知道，没关系！一天天慢慢来。

### The new developer mindset
### 新开发者的心态

Walking into a new company, there are many things you can't control, but there is one very important thing you can: your mindset.  **Your daily thoughts, practices, and how you internalize what happens around you will determine your success.**
步入新的公司，有很多东西你没法控制，但是有一个你可以控制的非常重要的事情，那就是你的心态。 **你每天所想、实践以及你如何内化发生在你身边的事情将决定你的成功。**

At times you'll be confused, at times you'll feel overwhelmed, and at times you'll even doubt if you can do this (I did). How you internalize these thoughts matters. Remember, this isn't unique to you—every new developer has faced this. Keep your mind in check and you'll push through.
有时候你会困惑，有时候你会感到不知所措，

When you run into something confusing or frustrating, re-position your mind:  _this obstacle is a learning opportunity._

It's an opportunity to understand something new and grow. It sucks, it feels bad, but soon after this you will be a better developer. And this will happen a lot—that's just the reality of being new to something.

Instead of internalizing:

> _"I got stuck 10 times today."_

Try instead:

> _"I had 10 opportunities to learn today."_

It's a powerful shift, and it will be obvious to your teammates and in your job performance.

Staying on top of your mind and not allowing the feeling of defeat to creep in will not only help you perform better in the situation, but it also increases the knowledge and skill you leave the situation with. Take a deep breath, take a break, ask for help—but keep pushing through.

And then at the end of the day: shrug it all off. Drop it on the ground when you leave the office or close your computer for the day. Start the next day fresh and ready for its own adventures.

Also, remember to celebrate the little wins along the way! Those small wins will stack up and become a large mountain of success over time.

Here's another important thing to remember:  **give yourself the freedom to make mistakes.**  You're going to break production, you're going to make some bad database updates (I definitely have)—it's recoverable, it's not the end of the world or your job, and any experienced developer has done it. It's just a part of the process.

### Your greatest skill as a new developer

You may not realize it, but your greatest skill as a new developer is that you've  **learned how to learn.**

You've learned how to take something hard, complex, obscure, and break it into pieces—work through it step by step.

More than learning JavaScript, React, Ruby, or anything else, the best thing you've learned is how to teach yourself. Take this practiced skill you have and show up with it every single day.

## Own your growth—no one else will.

This might be the most important statement for a developer at any stage of their career:  **your career is your own. You have to own it, and you have to own your growth.**

Sometimes the your company, job position, or boss will help facilitate your growth, but in the end, it's up to you.

Most companies have some kind of scheduled review process—possibly quarterly or yearly. If they do, great, but if they don't, own your growth! Ask your supervisor regularly for feedback, and do what they say. If someone mentions something you've never heard of, ask them about it or go do your own research it!

### "The Power of Tiny Gains"

![https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer.027.jpeg)

https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains

One of my favorite books,  [_Atomic Habits_  by James Clear,][1]  has a great diagram titled "The Power of Tiny Gains." It's a simple diagram. It shows the difference between a 1%  _improvement_  and 1%  _decline_  every day.

If you get 1% better every day, after a year you'll be almost 38 times better than you were at the start of the year! That's the power of "tiny gains," and it's just as true for becoming a great software developer.

Every day you have an opportunity to learn something new—no matter how tiny it is. Maybe it's a new function on arrays you didn't know about, a different method for structuring CSS, a new text editor shortcut, or something new entirely like learning SQL and how data is stored at the database level.

Regardless, aim to be 1% better every day (most days you'll end up doing much more) and the growth from the first few years of your career will be astounding.

### One page per day

![](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-29-at-10.10.23-AM.png)

I heard a story on a developer podcast once about the guy who maintains the  `pg`  gem for Ruby. This is the gem that is the interface between your Ruby code and the Postgresql database. It's some pretty serious stuff, and it's used by most Ruby developers every single day.

The story of how he became the maintainer of this gem was interesting. He said that when he was first getting started, he would open up the Postgresql documentation and read one page—just one page each and every day.

Over time, he grew an extensive knowledge of Postgresql and was able to start contributing to the  `pg`  gem. After a little while longer, he became the maintainer of that gem.

It's the perfect example of tiny gains stacking up—just one page per day. Any of us can do that, and I encourage you to take the same philosophy and apply it to whatever language or system you're working with!

### "Practice make perfect"

You've probably heard this phase before:  _"practice makes perfect."_

My piano teacher growing up used a different phrase:  _"**perfect**  practice makes perfect."_

I think he was right. I could practice the piano in the wrong way—with bad technique, sloppy, without a steady rhythm—and that's the result I would get: sloppy piano playing.

It's not just practice, but  _how_  you practice that matters. I could practice the first measure of a song over and over and get it down perfectly, but if I never pushed beyond the first measure I would never learn the song. I could play that first measure of the song at the level of a world-class pianist, but I wanted to  _play_  the piano, so I had to learn the whole song.

This is a perfect parallel for development. The way you "practice" development (your daily habits, methods and routines for development) determines the type of developer you will become.

In the beginning you'll make lots of mistakes (everyone does), but if you're conscious of your work, you'll notice areas you can improve. These are perfect practice moments: the opportunity to learn something new or do something in a better way.

When you look back on your career ten years from now, you will want to have had ten years of growth, practice, and learning—not one year of growth, practice, and learning ten times.

So ask those dumb questions. Ask the obvious questions. When someone mentions something you don't know anything about, boldly ask, "What's that?" My hope is that they respond in a kind and teaching manner, but regardless, be ready to learn.

It all comes back to owning your growth.

## T-shaped people

![A "T-shaped" person](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer2.001.jpeg)

A "T-shaped" person

In the beginning of your development career, there are so many topics that you can benefit from knowing, so you want to spread your effort and knowledge across a wide range of subjects.

If you're aiming at becoming a full-stack developer, that list might include things like HTML, CSS, JS, a backend language of your choice, SQL, Git, etc. There's so much easily attainable knowledge and benefit right on the surface of each of those topics that can be acquired by casting a wide net and taking it all in.

Over time, you'll find what type of development you enjoy most. Maybe it's frontend, backend, database work, ops, design—or some combination of those and more.

As your career progresses, you'll start to become a "T-shaped person." A T-shaped person is someone who, like the letter "T" is visualized, has a wide but shallow knowledge and experience about a lot of things, and a couple areas with a deep amount of knowledge and experience.

This deep knowledge takes a while to build up, and each step down is increasingly more effort than the previous—that's just the reality as you approach mastery of a subject. In the beginning, scoop up all of those easier beginner gains across a wide field of subjects.

Having this T-shape ability will help you become a better developer as a whole. Frontend developers who understand the database schema or backend developers who understand how those database tables are going to be used as models in the frontend will be more knowledgeable and better teammates than those who are siloed in their own area.

In the beginning this little foray into all of the aspects of development is also useful to find what you're drawn to, and to give you the bigger picture of all of the moving pieces in the software world.

Follow your interests and stay hungry to learn!

## Tips for being a great new developer

Now that we've covered your expectations and how to think about them, here's some practical tips to make you a great new developer—one your teammates love to work with.

### #1 Communicate really really really really really really well

You may not have incredible development knowledge and skill walking into your first day, but you  _can_ have incredible communication skills.

As a new developer, you're going to ask for help and guidance—a lot. And that's ok! Here's a tip for how to ask for help effectively.

Getting stuck is frustrating (it was for me). In these moments, it's easy to let that frustration overwhelm you and fire off questions to your teammate next to you (or maybe via email or a chat app).

Things like:

> "im stuck"  
> "it errored"  
> "the page won't load"

Now take a step back and view this from the perspective of the person you're asking help from. A message like  _"the page won't load"_  doesn't help this person help you at all. There's no context. There's no information for them to go on. In fact, they have to  _ask for more information from you._  This is incredibly inefficient and very frustrating for the person that is trying to help you.

A better way to ask for help is to think of it like a  [Mad Lib][2]™ (if you remember those):

> I am working on \_\_\_\_\_,  
> but when I try \_\_\_\_\_,  
> \_\_\_\_\_ happens instead.  
>   
> I've tried \_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_.  
> and I've looked at \_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_.

An example of this message might be something like this:

> I am working on  **the user password reset bug**,  
> but when I try  **to generate a password reset link**,  
> **the user's token is already empty**.  
>   
> I've looked at  **where the token is set**, and  **I can see the token in the database**,  
> but  **the token is missing on line X of File Y.**

If you sent someone the message above, they can understand:

-   What you're working on
-   What the problem is
-   What you've  _tried already_
-   Where the problem is

This is a wealth of information for the person you're asking help from. They will  **greatly**  appreciate that you gave them that information so clearly—and that you've already  _tried to fix it yourself._  This shows them that you respect their time, and you're not just looking for an easy handout.

There's nothing wrong with getting help, but if someone just fixes the problem for you they've really robbed you of the opportunity to learn and grow yourself.

It's not like there's ten problems you have to work through and you're done for the rest of your life—you'll face problems every single day as a developer. So the best outcome is if they give you enough help to get you unstuck but allow you to solve the problem yourself.

### #2 Hone your Google Fu

Just like developing skill in the physical martial art of Kung Fu, over time as a developer you will develop skill in the art of Google Fu—that is the art of finding answers by Googling them. This is a real skill that every experienced developer has and it is developed over time.

Sometimes, you just need to google the exact problem you have (this works great with error messages):

![Sometimes pasting the whole error message works](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer.041.jpeg)

Sometimes pasting the whole error message works

Sometimes googling the exact error message will produce the correct result, as it did above. You ran into a technical problem, and someone else ran into the exact same problem.

But sometimes, you need to edit the search query a little bit to remove project-specific info:

![Too much project-specific info returns no results](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer.042-1.jpeg)

Too much project-specific info returns no results

In the image above, Google has never seen the function  `whos_that_pokemon_its_pikachu()`  in the file  `gotta_catchem_all.rb`  (except now it has since I searched it :)). Removing that project-specific info and adding generic info returns better results.

![The underlying generic error](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer.043-1.jpeg)

The underlying generic error

### #3 Use a "try timer"

As a new developer you're going to get stuck a lot. There will be error messages you haven't seen before, and how you handle these situations will determine how quickly you grow as a developer.

Although these can be terribly frustrating moments, these are the moments where you will learn and you will grow. You don't learn by doing the same kind of work over and over again—it's by journeying through these bumps in the road that growth takes place.

When you run into one of these problems, take some time to try and figure it out yourself. Some companies will tell you this as a part of onboarding—something like  _"try for 30min before asking for help."_  In other companies it's not as clearly defined, but the message is still there: do your best and then if you're still stuck ask for help.

This not only allows you the opportunity to figure it out and learn for yourself, but it also respects the time of your teammates who are focused on their own work. Interrupting someone for something you could have quickly figured out yourself is a net loss for the team.

So give it a good try, and then of course ask for help!

Here's the secret to being a great new developer though:  **always reset the timer.**

Let's say you get stuck, try for 30min, and then ask for help. The next time you get stuck  **try again for another 30min**  before asking for help.

This may seem obvious, but on those days where it feels like you hit nothing but problem after problem, you're going to get frustrated and you're going to want to start asking for help as soon as the next problem arrives—it's just natural.

Take a deep breath, go for a quick walk, and approach each problem with a fresh perspective.

(This is, of course, easier said than done!)

### #4 Remember to relax and take breaks!

Remember to take breaks when things start to feel overwhelming.

Go for a walk. Go get a glass of water. Sleep on it if you can. Sometimes just getting up and moving for a minute can help you re-center yourself.

Remember that every developer was once in your place, and you will get through it.

Development will always be frustrating to some extent—you never stop making mistakes or running into problems. But over time you just get better at dealing with them, and your confidence to fix those problems increases so it bothers you less and less.

### #5 Ask the duck

Have you ever written an email or a text message describing a problem you have to someone, and right before you hit send you realize the solution? In the software world there's a phrase for this—[_rubber duck debugging_][3]:

> The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.

You see, by writing an email or talking to another person, you're forced to explain the entire context in a logical way in order for the other person to understand what's going on.

To explain the problem in this way,  _you yourself_  have to be able to think about and order it logically. Just the act of trying to prepare this context for someone else can cause you to think about the problem in a different light, and many times you'll find the solution yourself.

So relating back to using a try timer, before you ask for help, try explaining (or typing) up the summary of the problem in an email that you don't send. The chances are you'll gain new insight about the problem without having to interrupt another person, and worst case, you've got a great email or chat message to send them.

(I've seen many people put actual rubber ducks on their desk too!)

### #6 Take notes

This tip may seem obvious...but take notes!

You will be introduced to many different things when you first join a company: codebases, products, people, business logic, and it will be impossible to remember it all. Write this stuff down.

When I started my first job, my boss told me he had no problem explaining anything to me, but he didn't want to have to do it twice. I understood then, but now eight years later I really understand—it's all about respecting your teammates and their time.

If he explains something to me and I forget it, we've wasted both of our time—_and_  I'll have to ask him again. At his recommendation I even started putting physical sticky notes on my monitor of things I wanted to see often and remember. Things like:

> \- TRY FOR 30MIN  
> \- CHECK THE BUILD PASSES BEFORE ASKING FOR PR REVIEW  
> \- MAKE SURE YOU HAVE LATEST CODE

### #7 Fight against imposter syndrome daily

If you don't know what imposter syndrome is, it sounds like this in your head:

> I don't belong. I'm a fraud. Everyone else understands this but me.

This is a mindset you have to fight on a daily basis. There will be frustrating times as a developer, but you've faced frustration already and pushed through it. Every developer has felt this, and this too will pass.

In reality, imposter syndrome looks more like this:

Imposter syndrome

## The one key difference between a "senior" and "junior" developer

Sure, a senior developer has more knowledge and experience than a new developer, but that isn't what sets them apart. A senior developer has a  **problem solving system.**

When I first started in development I thought eventually I would stop making mistakes—that I would stop running into errors.

The opposite happened. I still make an incredible number of mistakes every day. Wrong syntax, wrong file, wrong function.

I didn't stop making mistakes—_I just got incredibly fast at fixing them._

This is a skill that is developed over time, and it requires intentional problem solving.

Here's some tips on how to build this system.

## 5 Debugging tips

### #1 Don't thrash your code!

One of the things I did as a new developer—and something I see many other new developers do when they run into a problem—is they start wildly changing things in their code. Instead of having a systematic evaluation process, they just make a ton of quick changes trying to see if that fixes the problem.

This is a very bad habit. You will only create more mistakes doing this. What you should do is:

### #2 Read the error message!

This tip may seem obvious, but actually  _read_  the message. What is the error? What is the file where this error is occurring? What  _line_  is this error coming from? This is all vital information.

If you resist just changing your code rapidly, you can jump  **straight to the exact place the error is happening.**

This is what the experienced developer does. Read the message—go straight to the problem.

Doing this will save you an incredible amount of wasted time and mental effort.

### #3 Don't waste time on the impossible! (Or at least the improbable)

![Don't waste time on the impossible!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/05/new_developer.059.jpeg)

Don't waste time on the impossible!

This is something I see new developers do often. They face an error in their code, they find something that they think is the problem, and they can't believe how it's not true. As an example:

> "I see the problem is on line 14, where it checks if the  `is_admin`  variable is  `true`, and it's not  `true`—but the user  _**is**_  an admin!!

They approach this problem thinking,  _"How can this be!!!"_  instead of,  _"How can this be?"_

There are times when you will encounter a core language or framework bug, but 99.9% of the time,  **you did something wrong or the situation is not as it appears.**

Instead of spending time marveling at the impossible unfolding before your eyes, question your assumptions about the situation. Something is not as it seems. Being aghast at the impossible is only a waste of time—start your problem-solving system.

### #4 "When in doubt, print more out." - Some wise person

I don't know who originally said this, but it's one of the most effective debugging techniques out there. When you don't know what's happening, start printing the state of your program in places where you think the problem is happening.

What is in the  `user`  variable? What is the response from the HTTP request? Did we take the  `if`  or the  `else`  branch in this situation? Did we even call this function or are we even on this page?

I've seen countless developers trying to debug and fix an issue (and I've done it many times myself too) when they weren't even working in the right file! A quick  `print`  or  `console.log`  will show you that you are in fact looking at the actual code being run.

### #5 Take it  _one_  step at a time.

A common mistake every new developer does:  **they do too much at once.**

They want to write code for 30min, click run, and see it work. What they find is that they spent 30min writing bugs and errors, and it's now a nightmare to fix.

When I go to make a new page in an app, the first thing I do is put  `<p>hi</p>`  on the page. I want to make sure that all of my internal code is setup correctly and I see that  `hi`  on the page. I take it one. step. at. a. time.

Do one thing at a time. Get  _"hi"_  printing on the page. Next get the user input. Next validate the input. Next save the input. If you take small steps you know exactly where to fix the problem when it occurs.

Even eight years later into a development career I still take it step by step. I know I'm going to make a ton of mistakes, and I want to know  _immediately_  when and where that happens.
