![我如何在10个月以内转行成为一个开发者:一个真实的故事](https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/images/1*P9eWpGDxFMTN2ApRQteOpg.jpeg)

这篇文章主要讲述的是在我40岁的时候，我如何从一个没有任何相关工作经验以及相关专业学位的情况下转行成为一个前端开发的。需要注意的是，在全职工作的同时我仅仅依靠自学而没有花费任何其他的费用。
> “外面下着雨，我正坐在马德里市中心的一家咖啡馆里，一边喝着咖啡一边敲着键盘。不久我将以前端开发者的身份开启全新的职业生涯。就在10个月之前,我还在 Granada 当英语老师，对编程一窍不通，而现在，我即将成为一名软件开发者，这是怎么发生的呢？”

就在几个月之前,当我为转行而开始做准备的时候，我写下了那些激动人心的话语。跟我来吧，我将与你们分享我是如何走到今天这一步的。

### Feeling special

当我刚开始考虑成为一个开发者的时候，我会将信将疑地阅读此类文章。我会试图找出这些文章作者所拥有的而我所没有的特殊的背景，这可能使得他们适合这种工作。

从那以后，我开始明白事情不是那样的。成为一名开发人员不需要任何的 "特殊" 的背景。我不会告诉你这非常容易，因为事实并非如此，但好消息是每个人都可以达到要求。你必须非常努力工作，学习很多东西，不能半途而废。当出现困难的时候，更不能退缩。当你自己觉得不适合做这件事情的时候，说服自己不要陷入绝望。以上就是你所需要的，每个人都可以通过练习来做这些事情。

我起步的时候没有任何相关背景。我并没有把钱花在昂贵的课程上面，在忙碌的一天工作之后我并没有太多时间去学习，同时我也已经步入中年。每个人的情况是不一样的，但是只要你用心去做，你就能做到。
### 背景

在我写下第一行代码的那天之前，我从未接触过编程，也从来没做过相关工作。在我职业生涯的早期，我从事餐饮行业。然后我获得了音乐相关专业的学位，之后再西班牙当了十年的ESL老师。我甚至对电脑的基本操作也不是很熟练。我总是对最新的科技感到好奇与兴奋。我认为程序员是这个时代的超级英雄。

不过，我从未想过自己动手做。部分原因是我认为编程只有精英才能做。这种工作是为那些从名牌大学毕业的聪明人所准备的。虽然这样的人确实存在，但是大多数人并不是好莱坞电影里面的那种有天赋的天才。开发远比我想象的要容易的多。
#### 故事起源
一切源于我与我的伴侣的一次热烈地交谈。她正在探索在STEM领域尤其是科技领域导致女性人数减少的原因。她决定通过成为一名程序员来改变这一现状。她想成为我们家族中年轻女孩的榜样。就这样，她开始学习了解了。

这很快也让我兴奋起来，因为我们意识到有很多可用的资源。这不是什么黑魔法，而是一种我们可以学习和掌握的技能。

剧透一下，她成功地从人力资源方向转行，事实上比我早一个月获得了开发的工作。

某一天我们在一个科学博物馆里面发现了一个有关儿童编程方面的书籍。一回到家我们就打开记事本写下了 "Hello world" 的代码并在浏览器里面打开，然后将页面颜色更改为红色。这是什么魔法！我们兴奋地尖叫着。

我彻底迷上了编程。我想要用电脑和代码做我想做的事情。

#### 我之前的工作

那时我已经做英语老师八年了。这不是典型的一个人在谈论他的没有前途的工作的场景。相反我非常热爱我的教学工作，喜欢工作的时候和孩子们在一起，而且我在工作场所很自在。这让我很满意。

但是有时候，即使你爱上了某样事情，你心里也知道是时候该继续前进了。这是我人生的一个新阶段，我有了新的展望和抱负。最重要的是，我想要一个新的挑战。让我远离舒适区。

### 通往成功的真正途径

显然这是不存的。我们三个人（我的伴侣、我和我的好朋友）为了转行几乎同时开始学习编程。我们三个人现在都在该领域工作，我们每个人的方法都不一样。每个人都有适合自己风格的方法。如果说我们之间有什么共同点的话，那就是我们没有放弃，没有半途而废。我们都付出了很多努力。

所以这里我要告诉你们的将不是一个通用的方法，而是我自己所特有的方法。这不是唯一的方法，可能也不是最好的方法。但是这对我很有效。

#### 开始

首先，我在 YouTube 上观看关于编程的视频，找到切入点。然后我开始学习 HTML 和 CSS。我按照教程构建了一些基本的web网页。我开始明白这是我想要从事的工作。

#### 设定目标

我向两个在这个领域工作的朋友寻求建议。那些鼓励的话语对我在前行的路上专注于一个明确的目标至关重要。

我花了些时间整理了所有的选项，并设定了对我有用的现实目标。我需要在最短的时间内转行成功。我没有其他的收入来源，这意味着我要继续做之前的工作直到我能转行为止。

我认为前端开发是初学者最容易进入同时是需求量最大的一个方向。我专注于初创公司所需要的技能而不是自由职业，这样我进一步缩小了范围。

然后我设定了最后期限。我不希望这个目标出现在一个我再也看不见的待办事项清单上面。2017年的春天，我向自己承诺接下来的教学将是我老师生涯的最后一站。就是说到2019年9月份，我将不会继续做老师相关的工作。

在这个阶段我能够把一切尽在掌握中么，这是不可能的。在做出如此具有冒险的职业选择时，肯定会存在不确定性。在那个阶段和整个过程中都存在各种各样的疑问。这里的关键是能否坚持不懈，不半途而废。一旦做出决定，我将沿着这条路走下去，看看未来将会发生什么。

#### 学习

我明白不断进步的唯一途径就是学习。我有一份全职工作，所以永远都不可能等到有时间的时候。我必须一边工作一边学习，要么就干脆不做。幸运的是，我的伴侣同时也在学习。这有助于安排我们自己的时间，以最大限度地提高学习时间。首先，我们执行我们自己称呼为 "周末训练营" 的计划，就是说我们会花整个周末来编程。典型的一天是这样的：

8:00 am: 起床，吃早饭。

8:30 am: 开始编程

12:30 pm: 去健身房

1:30 pm: 吃午饭 ，休息

3:00/4:00 pm: 继续敲代码 

8:00/11:00 pm: 完成一天的工作


Then my summer holiday came and I made the most of it by turning the “weekend boot camp” into the “daily boot camp”. I stuck to that schedule assiduously despite the temptation to enjoy the summer and kick back a bit.

September came and I was back to work. I had made a conscious decision to reduce my hours at work. I accepted that I would have less income in exchange for having more time to study. It was also another step to make my commitment to the career change more serious.

It is hard to convey how difficult it was to be away from my code. All I wanted to do was to be back at my computer to finish solving this problem or fixing that layout. But then real life kicks in. The start of a school year always requires a lot of time for preparation and organization. As any teacher will tell you, it also takes up a lot of one’s personal time too.

That was the moment my mission could have been derailed. Despite my best efforts, I had less and less time to code. I started losing my momentum. I tried to keep it up but there were days when I simply didn’t have time. Even with the best of intentions and good motivation, life can make things complicated.

My activity on GitHub showing the dip in October

However, as you can see from my GitHub activity image, I kept trying. I kept putting in the time, even if it was an hour, even if it was reading an article. I did everything I could not to get to the stage of losing all motivation. When you have left something for long enough, it makes it harder to get back to with every passing day.

Then as December approached, seeing the new year looming and my deadline closer, I rallied again and got organized. I started pushing through, putting in those hours no matter how tired I was and how little time I had. Sometimes I would get up early to code, sometimes I would stay up late.

This meant that my life was pretty much reduced to doing the job that was paying the rent, and studying. And little else. And I basically maintained that rhythm all the way until the day I started packing to move to Madrid. That was in the spring of 2018, several months before my deadline.

### Tools and resources

Over the 10 months leading to my job offer, I immersed myself in everything code related. The most frequent question I get asked on  [Twitter][2]  is about what resources I used. I’ve written  [another article][3]  that answers this question in-depth. However, here is a brief list of the most important tools and resources.

#### Courses

-   freeCodeCamp.org
-   Cassidy Williams and Colt Steele’s Udemy courses
-   Wes Bos’ JavaScript 30 and other courses
-   YouTube: Traversy Media, LevelUpTuts
-   Christina Truong’s Lynda.com courses
-   Udacity Front-End Nanodegree (a paid course, but I got a scholarship from Google)

Courses can only take you so far, so I complemented this with other tools to help me learn and get a job.

-   Twitter: a cornerstone of my experience. Especially the incredibly supportive and warm  [#100DaysOfCode][4]  community.
-   GitHub: an important tool to learn, and where I hosted all my projects for free. It’s usually the first place employers look to see your work.
-   Portfolio: I learned the most vital development skills by building it and other self-initiated projects.

You can also check out  [My Learning Tracker][5]  GitHub repo. It has a full list of the resources and paths I used those first ten months.

### Getting a job

Surprisingly, for me, this part was not overly complex. I didn’t send masses of CVs, or spend hours looking for jobs. Instead I opted for being selective and focused.

In the end I entered five interview processes. I got rejected from one, and failed to finish the take-home challenge of another. I completed three, and got three out of three offers. One of these was completely inadequate and unattractive. The other two, arriving almost at the same time, were both very interesting offers. One of them is my current job.

I don’t mean to sound nonchalant about this. It was an intense time. I still had no idea if my skills were anywhere near being employable or not. I entered processes not even sure if I was going to be laughed at for how little experience I had. It was a nerve-racking time, but it was an exciting and hopeful time too. And when I finally found myself with two actual good offers on the table I was elated and could hardly believe it.

I will always be eternally grateful to the individuals who made these decisions and decided to give me a chance.

The interview process in the two companies was very different. One was a series of video calls to talk to various people at the company. It was a small but well-established company hoping to build a new team of front-end developers. After a few weeks of back and forth, they made me my first real offer.

The other was a young startup in the middle of great growth. After a phone interview I got sent a technical challenge to complete within few days. It involved building a component, making API calls, and showing the correct information. Then came a video chat about the code I wrote. Then I got invited to have a drink with the tech team to find out if we click. After which I got an offer to join as a junior front-end.

In the end I had to choose. Which was a luxury I couldn’t believe I got. But I knew what I wanted, I took the offer with the  [startup][6]  based on one main point: they seemed to be very clear on the importance of mentorship and giving me guidance to grow and learn. That was the key. And it definitely was the right choice.

And so, on that rainy day in Madrid, after finishing my coffee. I walked into an office in the business area, introduced myself as the new front-end developer, and started my new career.

_I hope you enjoyed my story. If you did, you would make me happy if you give it some of those tasty claps. And you could even make my day by sharing it so more people can read it and learn they too can make it. I want to keep writing more of these articles. So if there is any particular aspect of this process you would like to know more about, I would love to hear about it. Come and say hi on  [Twitter][7]  @Syknapse_
